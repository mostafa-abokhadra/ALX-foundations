## Morning pages, movement, meditation

Here are the rules for how Morning Pages work:
- The ideal is to do them first thing when you wake up. But any time of day is OK.
- Get a pen and paper and just start writing (or keep a Morning Pages journal). You must do this by hand—don’t type!
- Write down whatever pops into your head. Really, whatever’s there—just write it!
- Don’t stop writing. Don’t re-read what you’ve written. Don’t go back and edit.
- If you don’t know what to write, then write, “I don’t know what to write. Maybe it’s because…” and you’re off again. Just keep the pen moving!
- Write 3 pages.
- When you’re done, put them in an envelope (or burn them). Don’t re-read them! Don’t share them with anyone!
- Remember, the point of Morning Pages is the process, not the product.

> [!NOTE]
> - the purpose of Morning Pages is NOT to produce creative writing. This is an important point to understand! Rather, writing Morning Pages provides you with the opportunity to clear out space in your head, so that your mind is more open to receive inspiration, Much of our creative thinking is not even conscious?!
Insight and creative ideas are more likely to appear when we are not working hard to try and force something to happen. That is why carving out intentional time to be in your body and not think is such an important skill!

### meditation 

This practice does not belong to a given culture or religion. It is simply the practice of relaxing the body and focusing one’s attention (usually on the breath) to gain a greater awareness of one’s thoughts and feelings. That’s it!

A common misconception is that the purpose of mindfulness is to “clear the mind” and have no thoughts. But this is not right! The purpose of mindfulness meditation is to become more aware of your thoughts and feelings. That’s it!
But, as an added benefit, it has been shown in hundreds of studies that it does help you calm your nervous system and lead to greater creativity, clarity, focus, and insight.
Perhaps you’re concerned that you don’t have the time? Don’t worry, even 1 minute of mindfulness meditation has measurable benefits! Try taking 2 slow breaths right now and see if you feel calmer.
