## Meditation
Mindfulness meditation is simply the practice of relaxing the body and focusing one’s attention (on your breath or an object of your choice) to gain greater awareness of one’s thoughts and feelings.

## web research
every question begs an answer! Every problem statement or problem definition is craving a solution. And there’s no better way to start developing or arriving at an “answer” for a problem or an inquiry than through research.

### research process

it is useful to remember that there will be times that you will NOT have to go through an incredibly rigorous research process to find the answers you need. So, in addition to the steps below, it is also useful to determine whether any of the following approaches can help you instead:

- **Discussions with internal experts**: Is there anyone within your organization who might have the intel you’re seeking?
- **Internal materials**: Are there any existing materials in the organization that might provide a quick path to the answers you’re searching for?
- **Government mandates**: Are there any policies or regulations that dictate the right pathway to take?

1. **Define your objectives, questions and hypotheses**. What are you trying to accomplish with this research? What do you wish to find out that will accelerate your work in the right direction?
2. **Determine your end outputs**. What type of data/information is ideal for you to find, based on what you are trying to accomplish? Do you need to present it in any particular format?
3. **Scope your main sources of information**. Do you already know where you might want to go to find the information you’re seeking? Are there particular entities or organizations that you know are seen as “experts” on the topic?
4. **Begin gathering your required information**. What search terms should you use? How many reports/articles do you want to read before deciding you have seen enough?
5. **Evaluate the validity/credibility of your sources and information**. From all of the information you’ve read or collected, which is most reliable? Are there any pieces of information that are validated across multiple sources? What about those that stand out / that are outliers? Which do you trust?
6. **Synthesize and communicate your key findings.** What are the key takeaways that you want to share? How can you share them in such a way that provides the most impact?
7. **Return to your original objectives and key questions to ensure you have answered them appropriately.** Have you found the answers you need or the direction you need to take?

#### how to skim internet articles (the magic of CTRL+F!)
open the research, use ctrl + f to find key words and read the complete sentence, copy past important information, summarize it using your own words (summarize don't explain), add the research link to your reference

## 10 Tips for More Effective Googling
1. **Use quotes to get an "EXACT" match**:
2. **Search within a specific site with _site_:** e:g site:freecodecamp.org react
3. **Exclude a term from search results with -**:  e.g. how to write components in React-class
4. **Search images of a particular size with _imagesize_**: "cute dog images imagesize:500x600"
5. **Search for a particular filetype with _filetype_**: react tutorial filetype:pdf
6. **Use wildcard * to make searches** e:g the * of money 
7. **Combine searches with OR , AND logic**: e:g React AND Angular, React OR Angular
8. **Filter out searches with AFTER: , BEFORE: or .. between two numbers**: e:g Reacttutorials AFTER:2020
9. **Check out related websites using related:** e:g related:google.com
10. **Use cache**: to see Google's cached version of a website

### evaluating a resource using CRAP criteria
- c for **currency**: puplication date
- r for **reliability** and **relevance**: summary, table of content or key words exists in the article or source, reference mentioned and links provided, does the source have a specific bias or slant of opinion
- a for **audience** and **author**: author or organization is an expert on the topic, for a websit check for .gov, .edu. .org, who is the intended audience of the articles ? puplic, students, professinals, other
- p for **purpose** and **point of view** : purpose of the author or organizatiion, why was the page put on the internet? for facts? sales or persuasion?, what is the goal of author, are there any advertisment present on the site

**in addition to CRAP**:

> Keep in mind that everything is written from a particular social, cultural, and political perspective. Realize that some publications tend to be ‘slanted’ towards a certain viewpoint.

## citing sources
While “citing sources” in the professional world is nowhere near as stringent as in the academic space, it is still important to be able to refer to your sources, especially when presenting your information to your team, manager, or executive leaders of your organization. Here are some examples of when knowing your sources will be crucial

- **Keep a list of all of the links that you have used in your research and which pieces of information you derived from there.**
- **Save important reports on your desktop or Google Drive so you can find them easily and they are easily searchable later on.**

## Ethical use of AI tools
ethical use of AI tools in web research are due to concerns related to privacy, data bias, transparency, accountability, misinformation, and regulatory challenges.

- **Full disclosure**: Always disclose when your work is AI-assisted by properly citing your sources. Passing off AI-generated work purely as your own is something we advise against.
- **Transparency**: Your users will want to know that the data you are collecting from them will at some point pass through AI tools, which is something not every user is comfortable with!
- **Responsibility**: Always use AI tools in a moral, ethical, and responsible manner.

- **Use AI tools to supplement, not replace, human judgment**. AI tools can be valuable for research, but they should not be used as a substitute for human judgment. It is important to carefully evaluate the results of AI tools and to use your critical thinking skills to make decisions.
- **Be aware of the potential biases of AI tools**. AI tools are trained on data that is collected from the real world, and this data can be biased. It is important to be aware of the potential biases of AI tools and to take steps to mitigate them.
- **Use AI tools in a way that respects the privacy of others**. AI tools can collect a large amount of data about users, and it is important to use this data in a way that respects the privacy of others. This means obtaining informed consent from users before collecting their data and using it only for the purposes that were disclosed to them.

### web research overview
Looking back to everything you have learned so far and the research that you just completed, let’s check a few things:

**Did you ask the right questions to inform your research? Why or why not?**

Recall that we gave you a way to check whether your questions are good! You can ask yourself more questions like:

- Does my question capture a complex issue or problem related to my chosen GCGO?
- Is my question nuanced, with no particular right or wrong answer or easy response?
- Is my question relevant to what is happening in the field? Do multiple stakeholders care about the answer to this question?
- Will I need to do more work to learn more about the factors affecting and influencing this question?
- Did you apply the research methodology or did some of the guidelines fall away?

**The guidelines were:**

- Define your objectives, questions, and hypotheses.
- Determine your end outputs.
- Scope your main sources of information.
- Begin gathering your required information.
- Evaluate the validity/credibility of your sources and information.
- Synthesize and communicate your key findings.
- Return to your original objectives and key questions to ensure you have answered them appropriately.

**Did your approach to the research align with research best practices?**
E.g., taking detailed notes

**Which research skills do you still need to build/improve further on? How can you do this?**

**Did you use AI tools ethically in your web research?**
