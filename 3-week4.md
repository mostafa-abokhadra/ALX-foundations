## web research
every question begs an answer! Every problem statement or problem definition is craving a solution. And there’s no better way to start developing or arriving at an “answer” for a problem or an inquiry than through research.

### research process

it is useful to remember that there will be times that you will NOT have to go through an incredibly rigorous research process to find the answers you need. So, in addition to the steps below, it is also useful to determine whether any of the following approaches can help you instead:

- **Discussions with internal experts**: Is there anyone within your organization who might have the intel you’re seeking?
- **Internal materials**: Are there any existing materials in the organization that might provide a quick path to the answers you’re searching for?
- **Government mandates**: Are there any policies or regulations that dictate the right pathway to take?

1. **Define your objectives, questions and hypotheses**. What are you trying to accomplish with this research? What do you wish to find out that will accelerate your work in the right direction?
2. **Determine your end outputs**. What type of data/information is ideal for you to find, based on what you are trying to accomplish? Do you need to present it in any particular format?
3. **Scope your main sources of information**. Do you already know where you might want to go to find the information you’re seeking? Are there particular entities or organizations that you know are seen as “experts” on the topic?
4. **Begin gathering your required information**. What search terms should you use? How many reports/articles do you want to read before deciding you have seen enough?
5. **Evaluate the validity/credibility of your sources and information**. From all of the information you’ve read or collected, which is most reliable? Are there any pieces of information that are validated across multiple sources? What about those that stand out / that are outliers? Which do you trust?
6. **Synthesize and communicate your key findings.** What are the key takeaways that you want to share? How can you share them in such a way that provides the most impact?
7. **Return to your original objectives and key questions to ensure you have answered them appropriately.** Have you found the answers you need or the direction you need to take?

#### how to skim internet articles (the magic of CTRL+F!)
open the research, use ctrl + f to find key words and read the complete sentence, copy past important information, summarize it using your own words (summarize don't explain), add the research link to your reference

## 10 Tips for More Effective Googling
1. **Use quotes to get an "EXACT" match**:
2. **Search within a specific site with _site_:** e:g site:freecodecamp.org react
3. **Exclude a term from search results with -**:  e.g. how to write components in React-class
4. **Search images of a particular size with _imagesize_**: "cute dog images imagesize:500x600"
5. **Search for a particular filetype with _filetype_**: react tutorial filetype:pdf
6. **Use wildcard * to make searches** e:g the * of money 
7. **Combine searches with OR , AND logic**: e:g React AND Angular, React OR Angular
8. **Filter out searches with AFTER: , BEFORE: or .. between two numbers**: e:g Reacttutorials AFTER:2020
9. **Check out related websites using related:** e:g related:google.com
10. **Use cache**: to see Google's cached version of a website

### evaluating a resource using CRAP criteria
- c for **currency**: puplication date
- r for **reliability** and **relevance**: summary, table of content or key words exists in the article or source, reference mentioned and links provided, does the source have a specific bias or slant of opinion
- a for **audience** and **author**: author or organization is an expert on the topic, for a websit check for .gov, .edu. .org, who is the intended audience of the articles ? puplic, students, professinals, other
- p for **purpose** and **point of view** : purpose of the author or organizatiion, why was the page put on the internet? for facts? sales or persuasion?, what is the goal of author, are there any advertisment present on the site

**in addition to CRAP**: 

![eedec3a2a296602411b8abd68983b3a78a38190e](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e8093965-ecf5-4d40-83df-aa535d02764f)

> Keep in mind that everything is written from a particular social, cultural, and political perspective. Realize that some publications tend to be ‘slanted’ towards a certain viewpoint.

## citing sources
While “citing sources” in the professional world is nowhere near as stringent as in the academic space, it is still important to be able to refer to your sources, especially when presenting your information to your team, manager, or executive leaders of your organization. Here are some examples of when knowing your sources will be crucial

- **Keep a list of all of the links that you have used in your research and which pieces of information you derived from there.**
- **Save important reports on your desktop or Google Drive so you can find them easily and they are easily searchable later on.**

## Ethical use of AI tools
ethical use of AI tools in web research are due to concerns related to privacy, data bias, transparency, accountability, misinformation, and regulatory challenges.

- **Full disclosure**: Always disclose when your work is AI-assisted by properly citing your sources. Passing off AI-generated work purely as your own is something we advise against.
- **Transparency**: Your users will want to know that the data you are collecting from them will at some point pass through AI tools, which is something not every user is comfortable with!
- **Responsibility**: Always use AI tools in a moral, ethical, and responsible manner.

- **Use AI tools to supplement, not replace, human judgment**. AI tools can be valuable for research, but they should not be used as a substitute for human judgment. It is important to carefully evaluate the results of AI tools and to use your critical thinking skills to make decisions.
- **Be aware of the potential biases of AI tools**. AI tools are trained on data that is collected from the real world, and this data can be biased. It is important to be aware of the potential biases of AI tools and to take steps to mitigate them.
- **Use AI tools in a way that respects the privacy of others**. AI tools can collect a large amount of data about users, and it is important to use this data in a way that respects the privacy of others. This means obtaining informed consent from users before collecting their data and using it only for the purposes that were disclosed to them.

### web research overview
Looking back to everything you have learned so far and the research that you just completed, let’s check a few things:

**Did you ask the right questions to inform your research? Why or why not?**

Recall that we gave you a way to check whether your questions are good! You can ask yourself more questions like:

- Does my question capture a complex issue or problem related to my chosen GCGO?
- Is my question nuanced, with no particular right or wrong answer or easy response?
- Is my question relevant to what is happening in the field? Do multiple stakeholders care about the answer to this question?
- Will I need to do more work to learn more about the factors affecting and influencing this question?
- Did you apply the research methodology or did some of the guidelines fall away?

**The guidelines were:**

- Define your objectives, questions, and hypotheses.
- Determine your end outputs.
- Scope your main sources of information.
- Begin gathering your required information.
- Evaluate the validity/credibility of your sources and information.
- Synthesize and communicate your key findings.
- Return to your original objectives and key questions to ensure you have answered them appropriately.

**Did your approach to the research align with research best practices?**
E.g., taking detailed notes

**Which research skills do you still need to build/improve further on? How can you do this?**

**Did you use AI tools ethically in your web research?**

# story telling
Stories can help to convey complex information in a simple and relatable way, allowing stakeholders to better understand and connect with new ideas and concepts
Sharing progress updates, success stories, and demonstrating growth potential can inspire and motivate.
Additionally, storytelling can help to create a sense of community and foster relationships among colleagues, helping to build a positive and productive work environment

### what is your story ?

When we listen to stories as audience members, we unknowingly respond and make judgments in our head about whether the story resonates or “clicks” with us and how the speaker does this. Below are a few of the characteristics we typically watch out for in the stories we hear and what effective storytellers can do.

![40fa8b3bc7017e2d4417ef8d8d41e3e58458d2aa](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b8c88e03-8c1a-4c31-9ef2-54457997dfea)

- watch [this](https://youtu.be/LmjKUDo7gSQ), the effect of a single story

## Steps of writing a story
1. **undrstand the audience**: Who will be reading your writing? What do they already know about the topic? What are their needs and expectations? What kind of language and tone do they respond to most? By understanding your audience, you can tailor your writing to their specific interests and needs
2. **Defining the purpose**: Once you know your audience, the next step is defining the purpose of your writing. What do you want to achieve with your writing? Are you trying to inform, persuade, or entertain? Knowing your purpose will help you stay focused and on track while you’re writing.
3. **Research background information**: To ensure that your writing includes all essential information, facts, and figures, it is crucial to conduct thorough research on the topic. Including graphs, charts, and images can help illustrate key facts and information.
4. **planning and organizing**: Before you start writing, plan and organize your ideas. Create an outline or a mind map to structure your writing. This helps in making your writing more coherent and easy to follow.
5. **stick to one topic**: Mixing an array of ideas in business writing reduces the effectiveness of the main message. Stay focused on one topic to avoid confusing the reader.
6. **writing clearly and concisely**: When it comes to professional writing, clarity and concision are key. Use simple, straightforward language, and avoid jargon or overly technical terms that your audience might not understand. Be concise and to the point, and avoid using unnecessary words or phrases.
7. **proofreading and editing**: After you’ve finished writing, it’s important to proofread and edit your work. Check for grammar and spelling mistakes, and make sure your writing is clear and easy to understand. Consider asking a colleague, friend, or Chat GPT to review your writing. Having a fresh set of eyes to look at your work can often catch mistakes or areas for improvement that you might have missed.
8. **following professional writing etiquetee**: In addition to the above principles, there are certain etiquette and formatting rules to follow in professional writing. This might include using proper salutations and closings in emails, using a professional tone and style, and adhering to formatting guidelines such as margins, font size, and spacing.

## Story Arc

<img width="506" alt="Screenshot 2025-06-12 215618" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8465d133-c2a7-4f5e-82dd-926fffe27a78" />

Beginning/Establish Routine ​– This is where the reader is introduced to
the characters, and we get a taste of what happens in their everyday life.

Example ​– Think of Cinderella sweeping the ashes or Harry Potter living with the Dursley’s. Trigger/Inciting Incident – ​Something beyond the protagonist’s control triggers the spark of the story causing the protagonist to act.

Rising Action/Conflict – ​The trigger results in a quest which often has obstacles, complications, conflict and trouble for the protagonist.

Example – ​Cinderella must endure the antics of her stepmother and stepsisters after her happy time at the ball. Harry stumbles through learning to be a wizard while finding clues about what the Dark Lord wants.

Crisis/Critical Choice – ​Along the way, there should be incidents of crisis followed by brief breaks. Often the protagonist must make a crucial decision. This is where we find out what type of person the character truly is. At the critical choice, the protagonist must decide to take a particular path.

Example – ​Cinderella decides to fight her Stepmother for her right to try on the glass slipper. Harry decides to stop Professor Quirrell from stealing the stone.

Climax – ​This is the highest point of tension in your story and comes fro mwhatever choice your protagonist made during the critical choice. It doesn’t have to be a huge battle between good and evil. It can be something as simple as an important decision being made.

Example – ​For Cinderella, it is the point where she attempts to escape her locked bedroom as her stepsisters try on the glass slipper. In Harry’s instance, it is his battle with Professor Quirrell.

Falling Action – ​This is where the consequences of the critical choice and climax play out. It should show the changed status of your characters – especially the protagonist. The changes must make sense with how the story unfolds. The outcome should be probable as nothing should happen for no reason.

Example – ​Cinderella meets up with her prince and gets married. And for Harry, it is his time in the hospital where Professor Dumbledore divulges the meanings behind the recent events.

Resolution – ​This is where the story wraps up. Your characters return to their lives but now are perhaps wiser or changed.

Example – ​We see Cinderella and her prince driving off in the carriage, presumably to live happily ever after. Harry gets back on the train to return to the Dursley’s but this time knowing that he will return to Hogwarts for another year of school.

If you search the Internet, you can find more complex diagrams of the story arc. Some use different terms or add more steps, but these are the basics of a story arc. Knowing these steps of the arc can help you in planning your story or at least making sure you stay on track.

## creating storytelling outline
in planning and organizing phase, you create your outlines, . Outlines serve as excellent aids for listing the main parts of your story, ensuring a key message in each section, and connecting all the elements together in a compelling narrative or structure.

### outline a speech
1. **opening**: get attention by tie in to the premise
2. **the premise**: it is the idea you are selling
3. **body**: 1, 2, 3, pointsd
4. **call for action**: what do they want from your audience to do
5. **close**: tied to the opening back again

### structuring a speech outline for a presentation.
tell them what you are gonna say, say it and tell them what you just said
- Tease your idea through a creative story or a similar approach.
- Tell them what you will talk about (preview).
- Walk through each topic.
- Review what you talked about.
- Include a call to action.

## writing to communicate information

![ba9301ff8d5eed776149db7046daefb1e5cb4bf2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8b50f5c1-b42f-4ff8-a799-ad7536bc1d39)

## Technical writing
Technical writing is a form of communication that conveys complex technical or specialized information in a clear and concise manner to a specific audience. It is usually used for the purpose of informing, instructing, or facilitating decision-making.

Technical writing requires both creativity and logic so that technical information can be clearly explained to a specified audience. In good technical writing, complex concepts and processes are broken down into easy-to-understand language. It is common that diagrams, charts, and other visual storytelling aids are used. Technical writers may create a variety of documents, such as user manuals, technical specifications, training materials, and research reports.

**example of technical writing**

- User manuals for software or hardware products, which provide step-by-step instructions on how to use them.
- Technical specifications for products or systems, which detail the technical requirements and capabilities of a product.
- Training materials for employees or customers, which teach them how to perform specific tasks or use specific tools.
- White papers or research reports, which communicate the results of technical research or analysis to a wider audience.
- Safety manuals or procedures, which provide guidelines and instructions on how to safely use equipment or handle hazardous materials.

> A powerful story can change the wrold

**With a single story, we can…** Inspire individuals to join our cause, Encourage donors to fund our projects, Illustrate our organization’s impact …and many more!

**Why are stories a great way to illustrate these problems?**

- **Relatability**: Stories have a way of grounding the problem in a reality that the average person can relate to.
- **Empathy / Sympathy**: Stories can show how a big problem affects people’s lives in a way that elicits an emotional reaction.
- **Concreteness**: Stories can also show how large, complex problems have a real effect on daily life as opposed to relying on statistics.

- ![186299602292e01ad1f21d6ac10c5faeb066e5e7](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/403db5e0-dd11-42ea-a31a-689db596edf1)

## storytelling for problem-solving.

1. **Problem Impact Assessment.**
   A Problem Impact Assessment helps you understand the primary stakeholders affected by the problem and how it impacts them. 

- Which groups of people are primarily impacted by this problem?
  - Individuals: Consider age groups, specific sectors, and geographic location.
  - Corporations: Think about industries, business size, and functional areas.
  - Public Entities: Include governments at different levels, non-profits, and NGOs.
  - Multi-national Organizations
- How does the problem affect each group? Consider areas such as lifestyle and quality of life, labour conditions, health and well-being (physical, mental, emotional), efficiency and productivity, safety and protection.
- How does this impact manifest in their everyday lives? Think about how the problem affects their daily routines and experiences.
- How does this impact change their quality of life or outcomes? Explore how the problem alters their overall well-being and results.
By addressing these questions, you’ll gain a deeper understanding of how to illustrate the impact of the problem more powerfully through storytelling.

## Stakeholder vs Audience
The stakeholders and your audience are distinct entities. 

**stakeholders** These are the individuals or groups directly affected by the problem. When considering the impact on stakeholders, think about their experiences, challenges, and needs related to the issue. Understanding their perspective will help you create a more impactful and relevant story.

**audience**: Your audience is the group of people you are presenting your story to. They may include stakeholders, as well as others who may not have direct involvement but have an interest in the topic. Tailor your story to resonate with the audience’s interests, values, and motivations. Consider how the story can engage, educate, or inspire them to take action or change their perspective

### Understanding Your Audience

![285e66540f7f515b47f376f0afca77dd58eed8b5](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b04cfad6-72eb-4e23-b980-e3cdf3d10e1c)

### Ethos, Pathos & Logos
the 3 persuasive appeals
1. **logos**: logical appeal, by facts, statistics, charts and graphs
2. **Ethos**: credibility appeal, establishing that the persuador is trustworthy maybe by showing where information come from or by using an expert or testemonial
3. **Pathos**: emotional appeal, the most affective, by creating an emotional response

## Identifying Key Messages
how you want your audience to FEEL, what you want them to THINK, and what you need them to KNOW after hearing your story. Once you understand these three things, you can work backwards to determine how you want to position the key messages of your story.

## Communicating for Impact in Agile Tech Teams
good written communication is crucial throughout a product’s development lifecycle

- **Clarity**: Agile teams need to work quickly and efficiently, and good written communication helps ensure that everyone is on the same page. When team members communicate clearly in writing, there’s less room for confusion, misunderstandings, or delays caused by having to clarify information.
- **Documentation**: Agile development often involves making changes quickly, and good written communication is essential for documenting those changes. Written communication, such as emails or chat messages, can serve as a record of decisions made, problems encountered, and solutions implemented, which can be used for future reference.
- **Collaboration**: Agile development relies on collaboration between team members, and written communication is a key tool for making that collaboration work. Good written communication can help ensure that team members are sharing ideas and working together effectively, even if they’re not in the same physical location.
- **Remote work:** In recent times, remote work has become increasingly common in technology companies, and good written communication is especially important in remote teams. Written communication can help ensure that remote team members stay connected and informed, despite not being in the same location. Think of the fact that we’re able to attend class at ALX today from different cities across the world with no technical hitches!

### Release Announcements Tips
1. **1. Know your audience**: This is important as it helps you tailor your communication to their needs, interests, and knowledge context. When you know their background, including what’s motivating their interest in the product or feature, you’re in a better position to make the communication more engaging, relatable, and persuasive!
2. **Keep the language simple**: When you do this, you are allowing people from different backgrounds and context levels to relate to and understand what you’re communicating. For example, if there’s a product release for an important developer feature in their favorite code editor, the author of the release announcement at the code editor company may be more inclined to use technical lingo that’s going to be more relatable to and understood by the engineers reading the announcement!
3. **Use a clear and concise subject line**: A clear and concise subject line’s purpose is to capture the attention of your intended audience. Making the subject line clear and concise enables readers to be alerted to its importance!
4. **Provide context**: Providing context reminds your audience of the importance of a particular feature. It reminds them that you’re listening to their feedback and are actioning requests from them. For example, good context might entail reminding your audience that a particular feature was requested by customers in feedback collected from them
5. **Provide next steps**: Next steps provide your target audience with actionable steps they can utilize to make the most of the communication you provided. It’s a call to action for the problem you’re helping them solve with the release that’s being made!
6. **Encourage feedback**: As usual, design thinking and improving your p
7. product over time entails listening to your customers and users. Encouraging the provision of feedback enables them to feel heard and you just might gain some loyalty points from them!

**Product or Feature Announcement Example**
![be3c4472f3a8c68b48b39d5cecae87ec0a5241bc](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d9165a1d-7b5f-4cc1-8619-4560ca9d9d77)

## Common Written Communication for Agile Teams: Stand-Up Updates
Stand-up meetings are scheduled within a team so that team members can coordinate, collaborate, and foster transparency in their workflows. They’re also known as SCRUM meetings and serve as a quick and informal way for team members to share updates, align their efforts, and address any potential obstacles or blockers.

Instead of stand-up meetings, some teams opt for an informal format where team members post their updates in a commonly shared communication channel such as Microsoft Teams or Slack. In general, when communicating with team members on a shared communication channel, keep the following tips in mind.

1. **Use clear and concise language**
When using team collaboration and communication platforms such as Slack or Teams, be brief and to the point. Assume that the people to whom you’re sending a message have loads of other messages to look at, so you’re only trying to capture their attention momentarily. Avoid unnecessary jargon and use plain language to ensure everyone understands the message quickly.
2. **Utilize the relevant channels**: When making an update regarding the progress of tasks assigned to you, make sure you use the appropriate channels. For instance, there will most likely be a dedicated channel (think of channels as stakeholder groups) for making stand-up updates for the team. Posting a stand-up message on a channel meant for sharing funny tech memes 💀 will probably defeat the purpose of the stand-up update. Don’t you think so?
3. **Leverage threads for in-depth discussions**: When an update is made to a channel and a discussion stems out of the update, lean towards creating responses on the thread as shown in the example below borrowed from Slack. Replying through starting a new update breaks the flow of the message intended to be communicated.
4. **Use @mentions effectively**: When you need actions on tasks to be handled by team members, make sure to mention them in your update which ensures full transparency into who should handle what, which should never be assumed. When the @mention list is too large for a collaboration platform update such as Slack, make use of emails!
5. **Set clear expectations for response time**: If something is needed for an upcoming release that’s bound to happen in three hours, it should be highlighted in the message to enable your intended audience to understand the time urgency required in their responses or actions.
6. **Respect teammates working in different time zones**: When working with teammates spread across vast geographical areas, consider their off-focus work hours. Unless something is time-critical and super urgent, it might suffice to mention that their response is only required when they’re back to their normal office hours.
7. **Encourage positive and constructive communication**: In principle, it’s important to understand how different collaboration platforms cater to our different communication needs and when to use each. It’s also important to know when to make a publicly facing update in one of the channels we talked about versus reaching out privately to the person whose attention you need on something.

## User-facing and Technical Documentation
You’ve probably tried to use new software or hardware products before, right? What did you do when you couldn’t figure out how to use a particular feature? You used Google Search or consulted a physical manual that came with the product in question to help guide you through your challenge. The documentation we use in this instance is known as user-facing documentation and is integral when a technology team is doing hardware and software releases.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Software and hardware that’s being developed also need to be documented every step of the way. This is also known as technical documentation since its main purpose is to act as a reservoir of information for the technology teams.

![1de2c56e2a3021aabfb9d8d4051001f9e3a0d5c2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ef9efec5-7124-406a-8f1c-b93efe168603)


1. **Knowledge Preservation and Sharing**
Documentation does serve as a repository of information that captures the collective knowledge and expertise of the team over time. It helps with making sure everyone on the team has the most up-to-date information regarding the software project in question which is great for collaboration.

2. **Onboarding and Team Expansion**
Documentation serves as an important resource when onboarding new team members to new roles providing them with a comprehensive understanding of the project, its components, and existing processes. Can you try to imagine what would happen if your first professional role was a technology team with no documentation?

3. **Maintaining Consistency**
Agile teams often work on complex projects that involve multiple iterations, sprints, or releases. Documentation ensures consistency in development practices, coding standards, and architectural decisions. It serves as a reference point for the team, ensuring that everyone follows the same guidelines and practices, even as the project evolves.

4. **Communication and Collaboration**
Agile teams often work with stakeholders, clients, or other teams within an organization. Documentation helps facilitate effective communication and collaboration. It provides a common reference point that can be shared with external stakeholders or non-technical team members to ensure a shared understanding of the project’s scope, progress, and technical aspects.

5. **Continuous Improvement**
Agile methodologies emphasize learning and continuous improvement. Documentation plays a crucial role in this process. By documenting lessons learned, feedback, and retrospective outcomes, teams can identify areas of improvement and implement changes effectively.

## Common Documents Maintained by Agile Teams

You may come across two types of commonly used documents that are commonly used in software development: PRD - Product Requirements Document and BRD - Business Requirements Document. While they may seem similar at first glance, they serve different purposes in the software development process.

### Product Requirement Document
A Product Requirements Document is a document that outlines the product requirements for a software application. It’s typically written by the product manager or business analyst and is used to communicate the product vision and requirements to the development team. The PRD outlines the key features, functionality, and user requirements for the product. It also provides details on the user interface, performance requirements, and any other non-functional requirements.

Example: A PRD for a mobile app might include details on the user interface design, the login process, the app’s core functionality, and any performance requirements such as load time or response time. Below, is an example you can look at. You do not need to read the document; just scan through it to get a sense of what a PRD looks like.

### Business Requirements Document
A Business Requirements Document is a document that outlines the business requirements for a software application. It’s typically written by a business analyst or project manager and is used to communicate the business requirements to the development team. The BRD outlines the business objectives, user needs, and overall project scope.

Example: A BRD for an e-commerce website might include details on the target audience, the business goals for the website, the user journey from product search to purchase, and any integration requirements with third-party systems such as payment gateways or inventory management systems.

The key difference between a PRD and a BRD is the focus of the document. The PRD focuses on the **product requirements and features**, while the BRD focuses on the **business objectives and project scope**. In practice, both documents are often used together to ensure that the development team has a complete understanding of both the business requirements and the product requirements. 

> [!TIP]
> In general, a PRD is used when developing new software products or major feature releases, while a BRD is used when developing systems that support the business goals of an organization.

## work planning

> Any activity that requires several steps can be called a project.

### project scope
In the project management process, project scoping typically comes **before** work planning, so let’s talk about that next.

Project scope is a crucial component of project planning as it involves determining a list of specific project goals, deliverables, tasks, costs, and deadlines.

It outlines the project’s boundaries to help the project owner/team remain focused on the task at hand and procedures for how completed work will be verified and approved.
A project’s scope also describes the project’s purpose, what is included and isn’t, and important processes, assumptions, and limits.
A scope is sometimes referred to as a statement of work (SOW), or terms of reference (ToR).

**an effective project scope statement will include the following elements:**

![74d8c3878b8e9f27abcca7c7957d48c2c64bbca1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/78acf6a3-37e0-4969-90cc-abe68c0d8922)

### Scope Creep
Have you ever come up with a great plan, but when you were executing it, you kept adding (or removing) aspects of it and then ended up with a different plan altogether? It is almost like planning to go to the store to buy food for tomorrow, then on your way, you remember that you need to pass by a friend’s. You decide to change your original plan and pass by your friend’s but never end up making it to the store.

In project management, we call this Scope Creep. Every project should start with a set of agreed-upon project requirements, but scope creep occurs when those needs are increased without permission or other safeguards. Scope creep – also known as feature creep, focus creep, creeping functionality, and kitchen-sink syndrome – can sneak up and destroy a project.

In any project, there tends to be a gap between what was planned and what actually happened. The addition of new objectives, deliverables, or tasks during the life of a project is known as scope creep because it essentially grows your scope steadily until you have more on your plate than you can handle.
