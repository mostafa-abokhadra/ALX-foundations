Mindfulness meditation is simply the practice of relaxing the body and focusing one’s attention (on your breath or an object of your choice) to gain greater awareness of one’s thoughts and feelings.

## web research
every question begs an answer! Every problem statement or problem definition is craving a solution. And there’s no better way to start developing or arriving at an “answer” for a problem or an inquiry than through research.

### research process

it is useful to remember that there will be times that you will NOT have to go through an incredibly rigorous research process to find the answers you need. So, in addition to the steps below, it is also useful to determine whether any of the following approaches can help you instead:

- **Discussions with internal experts**: Is there anyone within your organization who might have the intel you’re seeking?
- **Internal materials**: Are there any existing materials in the organization that might provide a quick path to the answers you’re searching for?
- **Government mandates**: Are there any policies or regulations that dictate the right pathway to take?

1. **Define your objectives, questions and hypotheses**. What are you trying to accomplish with this research? What do you wish to find out that will accelerate your work in the right direction?
2. **Determine your end outputs**. What type of data/information is ideal for you to find, based on what you are trying to accomplish? Do you need to present it in any particular format?
3. **Scope your main sources of information**. Do you already know where you might want to go to find the information you’re seeking? Are there particular entities or organizations that you know are seen as “experts” on the topic?
4. **Begin gathering your required information**. What search terms should you use? How many reports/articles do you want to read before deciding you have seen enough?
5. **Evaluate the validity/credibility of your sources and information**. From all of the information you’ve read or collected, which is most reliable? Are there any pieces of information that are validated across multiple sources? What about those that stand out / that are outliers? Which do you trust?
6. **Synthesize and communicate your key findings.** What are the key takeaways that you want to share? How can you share them in such a way that provides the most impact?
**Return to your original objectives and key questions to ensure you have answered them appropriately.** Have you found the answers you need or the direction you need to take?
