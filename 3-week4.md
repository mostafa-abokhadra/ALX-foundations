## web research
every question begs an answer! Every problem statement or problem definition is craving a solution. And there’s no better way to start developing or arriving at an “answer” for a problem or an inquiry than through research.

### research process

it is useful to remember that there will be times that you will NOT have to go through an incredibly rigorous research process to find the answers you need. So, in addition to the steps below, it is also useful to determine whether any of the following approaches can help you instead:

- **Discussions with internal experts**: Is there anyone within your organization who might have the intel you’re seeking?
- **Internal materials**: Are there any existing materials in the organization that might provide a quick path to the answers you’re searching for?
- **Government mandates**: Are there any policies or regulations that dictate the right pathway to take?

1. **Define your objectives, questions and hypotheses**. What are you trying to accomplish with this research? What do you wish to find out that will accelerate your work in the right direction?
2. **Determine your end outputs**. What type of data/information is ideal for you to find, based on what you are trying to accomplish? Do you need to present it in any particular format?
3. **Scope your main sources of information**. Do you already know where you might want to go to find the information you’re seeking? Are there particular entities or organizations that you know are seen as “experts” on the topic?
4. **Begin gathering your required information**. What search terms should you use? How many reports/articles do you want to read before deciding you have seen enough?
5. **Evaluate the validity/credibility of your sources and information**. From all of the information you’ve read or collected, which is most reliable? Are there any pieces of information that are validated across multiple sources? What about those that stand out / that are outliers? Which do you trust?
6. **Synthesize and communicate your key findings.** What are the key takeaways that you want to share? How can you share them in such a way that provides the most impact?
7. **Return to your original objectives and key questions to ensure you have answered them appropriately.** Have you found the answers you need or the direction you need to take?

#### how to skim internet articles (the magic of CTRL+F!)
open the research, use ctrl + f to find key words and read the complete sentence, copy past important information, summarize it using your own words (summarize don't explain), add the research link to your reference

## 10 Tips for More Effective Googling
1. **Use quotes to get an "EXACT" match**:
2. **Search within a specific site with _site_:** e:g site:freecodecamp.org react
3. **Exclude a term from search results with -**:  e.g. how to write components in React-class
4. **Search images of a particular size with _imagesize_**: "cute dog images imagesize:500x600"
5. **Search for a particular filetype with _filetype_**: react tutorial filetype:pdf
6. **Use wildcard * to make searches** e:g the * of money 
7. **Combine searches with OR , AND logic**: e:g React AND Angular, React OR Angular
8. **Filter out searches with AFTER: , BEFORE: or .. between two numbers**: e:g Reacttutorials AFTER:2020
9. **Check out related websites using related:** e:g related:google.com
10. **Use cache**: to see Google's cached version of a website

### evaluating a resource using CRAP criteria
- c for **currency**: puplication date
- r for **reliability** and **relevance**: summary, table of content or key words exists in the article or source, reference mentioned and links provided, does the source have a specific bias or slant of opinion
- a for **audience** and **author**: author or organization is an expert on the topic, for a websit check for .gov, .edu. .org, who is the intended audience of the articles ? puplic, students, professinals, other
- p for **purpose** and **point of view** : purpose of the author or organizatiion, why was the page put on the internet? for facts? sales or persuasion?, what is the goal of author, are there any advertisment present on the site

**in addition to CRAP**:

> Keep in mind that everything is written from a particular social, cultural, and political perspective. Realize that some publications tend to be ‘slanted’ towards a certain viewpoint.

## citing sources
While “citing sources” in the professional world is nowhere near as stringent as in the academic space, it is still important to be able to refer to your sources, especially when presenting your information to your team, manager, or executive leaders of your organization. Here are some examples of when knowing your sources will be crucial

- **Keep a list of all of the links that you have used in your research and which pieces of information you derived from there.**
- **Save important reports on your desktop or Google Drive so you can find them easily and they are easily searchable later on.**

## Ethical use of AI tools
ethical use of AI tools in web research are due to concerns related to privacy, data bias, transparency, accountability, misinformation, and regulatory challenges.

- **Full disclosure**: Always disclose when your work is AI-assisted by properly citing your sources. Passing off AI-generated work purely as your own is something we advise against.
- **Transparency**: Your users will want to know that the data you are collecting from them will at some point pass through AI tools, which is something not every user is comfortable with!
- **Responsibility**: Always use AI tools in a moral, ethical, and responsible manner.

- **Use AI tools to supplement, not replace, human judgment**. AI tools can be valuable for research, but they should not be used as a substitute for human judgment. It is important to carefully evaluate the results of AI tools and to use your critical thinking skills to make decisions.
- **Be aware of the potential biases of AI tools**. AI tools are trained on data that is collected from the real world, and this data can be biased. It is important to be aware of the potential biases of AI tools and to take steps to mitigate them.
- **Use AI tools in a way that respects the privacy of others**. AI tools can collect a large amount of data about users, and it is important to use this data in a way that respects the privacy of others. This means obtaining informed consent from users before collecting their data and using it only for the purposes that were disclosed to them.

### web research overview
Looking back to everything you have learned so far and the research that you just completed, let’s check a few things:

**Did you ask the right questions to inform your research? Why or why not?**

Recall that we gave you a way to check whether your questions are good! You can ask yourself more questions like:

- Does my question capture a complex issue or problem related to my chosen GCGO?
- Is my question nuanced, with no particular right or wrong answer or easy response?
- Is my question relevant to what is happening in the field? Do multiple stakeholders care about the answer to this question?
- Will I need to do more work to learn more about the factors affecting and influencing this question?
- Did you apply the research methodology or did some of the guidelines fall away?

**The guidelines were:**

- Define your objectives, questions, and hypotheses.
- Determine your end outputs.
- Scope your main sources of information.
- Begin gathering your required information.
- Evaluate the validity/credibility of your sources and information.
- Synthesize and communicate your key findings.
- Return to your original objectives and key questions to ensure you have answered them appropriately.

**Did your approach to the research align with research best practices?**
E.g., taking detailed notes

**Which research skills do you still need to build/improve further on? How can you do this?**

**Did you use AI tools ethically in your web research?**

# story telling
Stories can help to convey complex information in a simple and relatable way, allowing stakeholders to better understand and connect with new ideas and concepts
Sharing progress updates, success stories, and demonstrating growth potential can inspire and motivate.
Additionally, storytelling can help to create a sense of community and foster relationships among colleagues, helping to build a positive and productive work environment

### what is your story ?

When we listen to stories as audience members, we unknowingly respond and make judgments in our head about whether the story resonates or “clicks” with us and how the speaker does this. Below are a few of the characteristics we typically watch out for in the stories we hear and what effective storytellers can do.

![40fa8b3bc7017e2d4417ef8d8d41e3e58458d2aa](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b8c88e03-8c1a-4c31-9ef2-54457997dfea)

- watch [this](https://youtu.be/LmjKUDo7gSQ), the effect of a single story

## Steps of writing a story
1. **undrstand the audience**: Who will be reading your writing? What do they already know about the topic? What are their needs and expectations? What kind of language and tone do they respond to most? By understanding your audience, you can tailor your writing to their specific interests and needs
2. **Defining the purpose**: Once you know your audience, the next step is defining the purpose of your writing. What do you want to achieve with your writing? Are you trying to inform, persuade, or entertain? Knowing your purpose will help you stay focused and on track while you’re writing.
3. **Research background information**: To ensure that your writing includes all essential information, facts, and figures, it is crucial to conduct thorough research on the topic. Including graphs, charts, and images can help illustrate key facts and information.
4. **planning and organizing**: Before you start writing, plan and organize your ideas. Create an outline or a mind map to structure your writing. This helps in making your writing more coherent and easy to follow.
5. **stick to one topic**: Mixing an array of ideas in business writing reduces the effectiveness of the main message. Stay focused on one topic to avoid confusing the reader.
6. **writing clearly and concisely**: When it comes to professional writing, clarity and concision are key. Use simple, straightforward language, and avoid jargon or overly technical terms that your audience might not understand. Be concise and to the point, and avoid using unnecessary words or phrases.
7. **proofreading and editing**: After you’ve finished writing, it’s important to proofread and edit your work. Check for grammar and spelling mistakes, and make sure your writing is clear and easy to understand. Consider asking a colleague, friend, or Chat GPT to review your writing. Having a fresh set of eyes to look at your work can often catch mistakes or areas for improvement that you might have missed.
8. **following professional writing etiquetee**: In addition to the above principles, there are certain etiquette and formatting rules to follow in professional writing. This might include using proper salutations and closings in emails, using a professional tone and style, and adhering to formatting guidelines such as margins, font size, and spacing.

## Story Arc

Beginning/Establish Routine ​– This is where the reader is introduced to
the characters, and we get a taste of what happens in their everyday life.

Example ​– Think of Cinderella sweeping the ashes or Harry Potter living with the Dursley’s. Trigger/Inciting Incident – ​Something beyond the protagonist’s control triggers the spark of the story causing the protagonist to act.

Rising Action/Conflict – ​The trigger results in a quest which often has obstacles, complications, conflict and trouble for the protagonist.

Example – ​Cinderella must endure the antics of her stepmother and stepsisters after her happy time at the ball. Harry stumbles through learning to be a wizard while finding clues about what the Dark Lord wants.

Crisis/Critical Choice – ​Along the way, there should be incidents of crisis followed by brief breaks. Often the protagonist must make a crucial decision. This is where we find out what type of person the character truly is. At the critical choice, the protagonist must decide to take a particular path.

Example – ​Cinderella decides to fight her Stepmother for her right to try on the glass slipper. Harry decides to stop Professor Quirrell from stealing the stone.

Climax – ​This is the highest point of tension in your story and comes fro mwhatever choice your protagonist made during the critical choice. It doesn’t have to be a huge battle between good and evil. It can be something as simple as an important decision being made.

Example – ​For Cinderella, it is the point where she attempts to escape her locked bedroom as her stepsisters try on the glass slipper. In Harry’s instance, it is his battle with Professor Quirrell.

Falling Action – ​This is where the consequences of the critical choice and climax play out. It should show the changed status of your characters – especially the protagonist. The changes must make sense with how the story unfolds. The outcome should be probable as nothing should happen for no reason.

Example – ​Cinderella meets up with her prince and gets married. And for Harry, it is his time in the hospital where Professor Dumbledore divulges the meanings behind the recent events.

Resolution – ​This is where the story wraps up. Your characters return to their lives but now are perhaps wiser or changed.

Example – ​We see Cinderella and her prince driving off in the carriage, presumably to live happily ever after. Harry gets back on the train to return to the Dursley’s but this time knowing that he will return to Hogwarts for another year of school.

If you search the Internet, you can find more complex diagrams of the story arc. Some use different terms or add more steps, but these are the basics of a story arc. Knowing these steps of the arc can help you in planning your story or at least making sure you stay on track.

## creating storytelling outline
in planning and organizing phase, you create your outlines, . Outlines serve as excellent aids for listing the main parts of your story, ensuring a key message in each section, and connecting all the elements together in a compelling narrative or structure.

### outline a speech
1. **opening**: get attention by tie in to the premise
2. **the premise**: it is the idea you are selling
3. **body**: 1, 2, 3, pointsd
4. **call for action**: what do they want from your audience to do
5. **close**: tied to the opening back again

### structuring a speech outline for a presentation.
tell them what you are gonna say, say it and tell them what you just said
- Tease your idea through a creative story or a similar approach.
- Tell them what you will talk about (preview).
- Walk through each topic.
- Review what you talked about.
- Include a call to action.

## writing to communicate information

![ba9301ff8d5eed776149db7046daefb1e5cb4bf2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8b50f5c1-b42f-4ff8-a799-ad7536bc1d39)

## Technical writing
Technical writing is a form of communication that conveys complex technical or specialized information in a clear and concise manner to a specific audience. It is usually used for the purpose of informing, instructing, or facilitating decision-making.

Technical writing requires both creativity and logic so that technical information can be clearly explained to a specified audience. In good technical writing, complex concepts and processes are broken down into easy-to-understand language. It is common that diagrams, charts, and other visual storytelling aids are used. Technical writers may create a variety of documents, such as user manuals, technical specifications, training materials, and research reports.

**example of technical writing**

- User manuals for software or hardware products, which provide step-by-step instructions on how to use them.
- Technical specifications for products or systems, which detail the technical requirements and capabilities of a product.
- Training materials for employees or customers, which teach them how to perform specific tasks or use specific tools.
- White papers or research reports, which communicate the results of technical research or analysis to a wider audience.
- Safety manuals or procedures, which provide guidelines and instructions on how to safely use equipment or handle hazardous materials.
