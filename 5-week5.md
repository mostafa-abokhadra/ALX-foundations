### problem definition, statement and approaches recap
To be able to define a problem more concretely and succinctly, we can use the **5Ws+H** Who, What, Where, When, Why, and How.

These can be better answered by developing a problem statement, and a good way to develop an effective problem statement is to use a problem-solving framework.

### Cool Head Warm Heart Framework
The Cool Head Warm Heart framework is a decision-making approach with six key elements.

- **Helpful Frame** : Clearly define the problem, identify stakeholders, determine the decisionâ€™s scope, and consider constraints and opportunities. Seek input from different perspectives.
- **Creative Alternatives**: Generate diverse potential solutions that address the defined problem. Think outside the box and consider various viewpoints and approaches.
Useful Information
- **Gather and analyze relevant**, reliable data to inform the decision-making process. Evaluate sources and synthesize information effectively.
- **Clear Values**: Understand and prioritize the values and principles important to the decision-maker and stakeholders. Consider ethical, moral, cultural, and social aspects.
Sound Reasoning
- **Apply logical and critical thinking skills to evaluate the potential consequences of each alternative**: Weigh pros and cons, assess risks and benefits, and anticipate unintended outcomes.
Commitment to Action
- **Make a final decision and take action based on the chosen alternative**. Communicate, implement the decision effectively, and monitor outcomes to achieve desired results.

### McKinsey Problem Solving Framework
This framework is commonly utilized in business and consulting contexts, proving especially valuable for **data analysis and the development of data-driven and evidence-based** solutions.

This framework involves addressing six essential questions:

- What is the problem?
- Where and when does the problem occur?
- Who is affected by the problem?
- What factors will contribute to the success of a solution?
- What are the boundaries or limitations of this problem?
- Who or what may hinder the implementation of the solution?
