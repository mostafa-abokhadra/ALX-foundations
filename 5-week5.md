# Week 5

### problem definition, statement and approaches recap
To be able to define a problem more concretely and succinctly, we can use the **5Ws+H** Who, What, Where, When, Why, and How.

These can be better answered by developing a problem statement, and a good way to develop an effective problem statement is to use a problem-solving framework.

### Cool Head Warm Heart Framework
The Cool Head Warm Heart framework is a decision-making approach with six key elements.

- **Helpful Frame** : Clearly define the problem, identify stakeholders, determine the decision’s scope, and consider constraints and opportunities. Seek input from different perspectives.
- **Creative Alternatives**: Generate diverse potential solutions that address the defined problem. Think outside the box and consider various viewpoints and approaches.
Useful Information
- **Gather and analyze relevant**, reliable data to inform the decision-making process. Evaluate sources and synthesize information effectively.
- **Clear Values**: Understand and prioritize the values and principles important to the decision-maker and stakeholders. Consider ethical, moral, cultural, and social aspects.
Sound Reasoning
- **Apply logical and critical thinking skills to evaluate the potential consequences of each alternative**: Weigh pros and cons, assess risks and benefits, and anticipate unintended outcomes.
Commitment to Action
- **Make a final decision and take action based on the chosen alternative**. Communicate, implement the decision effectively, and monitor outcomes to achieve desired results.

### McKinsey Problem Solving Framework
This framework is commonly utilized in business and consulting contexts, proving especially valuable for **data analysis and the development of data-driven and evidence-based** solutions.

This framework involves addressing six essential questions:

- What is the problem?
- Where and when does the problem occur?
- Who is affected by the problem?
- What factors will contribute to the success of a solution?
- What are the boundaries or limitations of this problem?
- Who or what may hinder the implementation of the solution?

**the NO-NOs are…**

Micromanaging: Trust your teammates to deliver on their responsibilities. Avoid excessive control or micromanagement, as it can hinder creativity, motivation, and autonomy within the team.

Being Afraid to Ask for Help: It’s okay to ask for assistance when needed. Don’t let ego or fear hold you back from seeking support from your teammates. Remember, you’re a team, and you’re in it together.

Negativity and Blame Games: Foster a positive team environment by refraining from negative criticism, blame games, or gossip. Instead, focus on constructive feedback and finding solutions to challenges.

Ignoring Conflict: It’s not going to magically disappear so address conflict proactively rather than sweeping it under the rug. Always encourage open dialogue, and active listening, and seek resolutions that benefit the entire team.

Procrastination: (Is that even a word in our ALX Dictionary). As young leaders we get things done, but assuming procrastination is actually a thing, it can significantly hinder progress and impact team morale. Stay organized, manage your time effectively, and meet deadlines to ensure a smooth workflow within the team.

## Agile team

agile is a set of values and principles, it's a collection of beleifs that team can use to make decisions about how to do the work of developing software, a team who take decision that match with the team principles and values are agile

Agile methodology is an iterative approach to software development that emphasizes collaboration, flexibility, and responsiveness to change. It’s a set of values and principles that guide the way software development teams work together to deliver high-quality software that meets customer needs.

### why does agile matter

In an agile approach, the software is developed in short iterations called sprints, typically lasting one or two weeks, during which the development team works collaboratively to deliver a set of features or functionalities. The product manager or product owner defines and prioritizes the product backlog, which is a list of features and functionalities that need to be developed over a certain time duration.

The development team is cross-functional, which means that it includes individuals with different skills and expertise, such as developers, testers, and designers. The team is self-organizing and manages its own work, making decisions about how to accomplish its goals. In other words, Agile teams are set up to quickly solve problems and deliver output, without needing outside help.

And this is why Agile methodology matters to people entering into the tech ecosystem. It has become the dominant approach to software development in recent years. Companies across all industries are adopting agile methodology as a way to stay competitive and respond quickly to changing customer needs and market conditions. As a result, many job postings in the technology industry now require experience or knowledge of agile methodology.

### agile frameworks

For example, the length of a sprint can vary, in fact, some organizations call them cycles instead of sprints! Some organizations include design as part of the sprints, while others make them part of backlog definition.

n other words, organizations often choose the framework that best suits their needs. It is common for a technology team to use multiple approaches for different scenarios. This means that different teams can use different approaches to the Agile Framework. Some of the most common Agile Frameworks are:

- **SCRUM (most common)**
- **Kanban**
- **Lean**

The diagram below illustrates the differences in structure between Kanban and SCRUM.

## Benefits of agile team
1. **Faster time-to-market**: Agile teams can deliver working software in short iterations, allowing organizations to respond quickly to changing market conditions, customer needs and feedback. One way to do it is to build a Minimum Viable Product (MVP). An MVP is a simple, first version of a product or app that has just enough features to solve a specific problem and gather feedback from users. It’s like a basic model of a car that lets you drive and get feedback before adding more fancy features such as air conditioning, heated seats etc
2. **Increased collaboration**: Agile teams work closely together, breaking down silos and fostering better communication and collaboration between team members. This means that these teams can often work more independently to find solutions and produce results faster
3. **Higher quality**:Agile methodology emphasizes testing and feedback, allowing teams to catch and fix defects earlier in the development process. This iterative method means that the output is more stable and functional.
4. **Flexibility**: Agile methodology is adaptable to changes in project requirements, allowing teams to pivot and adjust their approach as needed. Since the team consists of a diverse set of talents, it often doesn’t have to wait for another department or team to get involved and can resolve issues on its own.

Overall, the agile set of values is a key skill for anyone entering the technology industry, as it’s become an essential approach to software development in today’s fast-paced and ever-changing business environment.

### agile workflow
Now that you know what the Agile Framework is and how it functions, let’s take a closer look at how Agile Teams work within this framework. This is important because agile teams are the name of the game in the tech industry. If you’re starting your career in tech, chances are you’re going to work in or as part of an agile team!

As we’ve mentioned before, agile teams work together to deliver high-quality software in an iterative and incremental manner. They’re like the Avengers of the tech world, working together to release excellent software step by step. They’re not waiting around for a manager to shout out orders. Nope, they’re the captains of their own ship, making decisions and steering towards success. Traditional teams might need a bossy boss, but agile teams? They’re the masters of their own destiny! In other words, Agile Teams are responsible for managing their own work and making decisions to achieve goals. They don’t need constant direction.

Now in order to be self-organizing and take ownership, these teams are empowered to make decisions about their work. This includes how to plan and execute their tasks, how to communicate with one another, and how to resolve conflicts and issues that arise. Plus, they keep tabs on their progress and aren’t afraid to switch gears and make adjustments if needed. Talk about flexibility at its finest!

So why does this matter? Well, it’s the secret sauce of the Agile Methodology. They are an important aspect of the Agile Methodology because they allow for more flexibility and adaptability in the process of developing software. When teams have control, it fosters creativity, innovation, and teamwork. Each team member is fully invested in the project’s success.

### difference between traditional team and agile team
![3d8052b40268196a5fdd8ae9293a2eefb6731a15](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b6cbd176-bf86-4660-85db-0e0f256eea4f)

Let’s imagine an agile development team working on a software development project. The team is made up of a front-end developer, two back-end developers, a tester, a product manager, and a scrum master. They work in short, time-boxed iterations called sprints, usually lasting one or two weeks. During a sprint, the team focuses on delivering a set of features or functionalities.

At the beginning of each sprint, the team holds a sprint planning meeting to define the work to be done and estimate the effort required, which usually refers to the time it would take to complete the task.

During the sprint, the team works collaboratively to complete the work, holding daily stand-up meetings to keep everyone informed and identify any obstacles that need to be addressed. At the end of the sprint, the team holds a sprint review or retrospective to reflect on their progress and identify areas for improvement. By the way, retrospectives are also referred to as retros in up-to-date tech language.

The team is self-organizing, meaning they manage their own work and make decisions about how to accomplish their goals.

Now, let’s imagine a traditional development team working on the same software project. The team is composed of front-end and back-end developers, testers, a project manager, and a business analyst. Notice the difference in composition? The team follows a sequential, waterfall approach to software development, with a clear division of labour between team members.

The project manager is responsible for defining the scope and requirements of the project, and the business analyst is responsible for documenting those requirements.

The developers and testers work separately to complete their assigned tasks. The project manager monitors the progress of the project and reports to higher-ups on a regular basis. Team members receive direction and oversight from the project manager and are expected to follow a defined process for completing their work.

As you can see, the Agile team and the traditional team have different approaches to software development. The agile team is more collaborative, flexible, and self-organizing, while the traditional team is more structured, hierarchical, and process-driven. The agile team is better equipped to respond to changing requirements and deliver high-quality software in a fast-paced environment, while the traditional team may struggle to adapt to changing conditions and may be slower to deliver software.

### sprint planning and meetings and retros

Time to get into the weeds. When you’re working in technology teams that practice Agile development, there are several events that you will almost surely come across and be part of. The most important of these are Sprint Planning Meetings and Sprint Retrospectives. In the next few pages, you will learn more about what they entail and the best practices to have successful sprints.

You could also think of these touch points in the context of your group work as part of this program. For example, each weekly period can be thought of as a sprint. This sprint has a goal which is the deliverable for your group work. So following the Agile framework, you will be working on the tasks planned at the beginning of the sprint in a sprint planning meeting that you conduct with your group!

> In a sprint planning meeting, the team decides which tasks to work on in the next sprint and who will handle them. The meeting is attended by key stakeholders people like the Product Manager, UI/UX Designers, Engineers, and other team members.


Remember the different roles we learned about in week 5? Those are some of the team members we might expect to attend sprint planning meetings. The meeting occurs at the beginning of each sprint. During this meeting, tasks and responsibilities are assigned.

To assign roles effectively, you might want to act as the project manager of your team. Project management is related to product management but, also vastly different. In fact, project management is a subset of product management. Project managers plan, organize, and oversee projects from start to finish. They are very important in making sure projects are done well within the planned scope, budget, and time. If you choose this role, you’ll probably lead the Sprint Planning Meeting. This meeting makes sure everyone knows what needs to be done.

But how can you as a project manager do so? Well, remember the backlog we covered a few weeks back? If you can’t recall what this is, check out the ‘tech terms recap’ lesson in week 5. Basically, you can use the backlog to determine the goal and tasks for the sprint.

These backlogs are usually groomed ahead of the sprint planning meeting by the Product or Project Manager. To groom a backlog, ensure that tasks or tickets in your project management platform have the correct details. This includes effort required, user stories, and acceptance criteria. A well-groomed backlog ensures that a sprint planning meeting is organized and thorough. When you plan for your team meeting, creating an agenda helps with future backlog grooming.

The meeting starts with the Product Manager presenting the project’s vision and goals. The team works together to set a clear goal for the sprint. This goal represents what they want to achieve. For example, if the project is to develop a mobile app, the sprint goal could be to implement the login functionality.
