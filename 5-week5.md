# Week 5

### problem definition, statement and approaches recap
To be able to define a problem more concretely and succinctly, we can use the **5Ws+H** Who, What, Where, When, Why, and How.

These can be better answered by developing a problem statement, and a good way to develop an effective problem statement is to use a problem-solving framework.

### Cool Head Warm Heart Framework
The Cool Head Warm Heart framework is a decision-making approach with six key elements.

- **Helpful Frame** : Clearly define the problem, identify stakeholders, determine the decision’s scope, and consider constraints and opportunities. Seek input from different perspectives.
- **Creative Alternatives**: Generate diverse potential solutions that address the defined problem. Think outside the box and consider various viewpoints and approaches.
Useful Information
- **Gather and analyze relevant**, reliable data to inform the decision-making process. Evaluate sources and synthesize information effectively.
- **Clear Values**: Understand and prioritize the values and principles important to the decision-maker and stakeholders. Consider ethical, moral, cultural, and social aspects.
Sound Reasoning
- **Apply logical and critical thinking skills to evaluate the potential consequences of each alternative**: Weigh pros and cons, assess risks and benefits, and anticipate unintended outcomes.
Commitment to Action
- **Make a final decision and take action based on the chosen alternative**. Communicate, implement the decision effectively, and monitor outcomes to achieve desired results.

### McKinsey Problem Solving Framework
This framework is commonly utilized in business and consulting contexts, proving especially valuable for **data analysis and the development of data-driven and evidence-based** solutions.

This framework involves addressing six essential questions:

- What is the problem?
- Where and when does the problem occur?
- Who is affected by the problem?
- What factors will contribute to the success of a solution?
- What are the boundaries or limitations of this problem?
- Who or what may hinder the implementation of the solution?

**the NO-NOs are…**

Micromanaging: Trust your teammates to deliver on their responsibilities. Avoid excessive control or micromanagement, as it can hinder creativity, motivation, and autonomy within the team.

Being Afraid to Ask for Help: It’s okay to ask for assistance when needed. Don’t let ego or fear hold you back from seeking support from your teammates. Remember, you’re a team, and you’re in it together.

Negativity and Blame Games: Foster a positive team environment by refraining from negative criticism, blame games, or gossip. Instead, focus on constructive feedback and finding solutions to challenges.

Ignoring Conflict: It’s not going to magically disappear so address conflict proactively rather than sweeping it under the rug. Always encourage open dialogue, and active listening, and seek resolutions that benefit the entire team.

Procrastination: (Is that even a word in our ALX Dictionary). As young leaders we get things done, but assuming procrastination is actually a thing, it can significantly hinder progress and impact team morale. Stay organized, manage your time effectively, and meet deadlines to ensure a smooth workflow within the team.

## Agile team

agile is a set of values and principles, it's a collection of beleifs that team can use to make decisions about how to do the work of developing software, a team who take decision that match with the team principles and values are agile

Agile methodology is an iterative approach to software development that emphasizes collaboration, flexibility, and responsiveness to change. It’s a set of values and principles that guide the way software development teams work together to deliver high-quality software that meets customer needs.

### why does agile matter

In an agile approach, the software is developed in short iterations called sprints, typically lasting one or two weeks, during which the development team works collaboratively to deliver a set of features or functionalities. The product manager or product owner defines and prioritizes the product backlog, which is a list of features and functionalities that need to be developed over a certain time duration.

The development team is cross-functional, which means that it includes individuals with different skills and expertise, such as developers, testers, and designers. The team is self-organizing and manages its own work, making decisions about how to accomplish its goals. In other words, Agile teams are set up to quickly solve problems and deliver output, without needing outside help.

And this is why Agile methodology matters to people entering into the tech ecosystem. It has become the dominant approach to software development in recent years. Companies across all industries are adopting agile methodology as a way to stay competitive and respond quickly to changing customer needs and market conditions. As a result, many job postings in the technology industry now require experience or knowledge of agile methodology.

### agile frameworks

For example, the length of a sprint can vary, in fact, some organizations call them cycles instead of sprints! Some organizations include design as part of the sprints, while others make them part of backlog definition.

in other words, organizations often choose the framework that best suits their needs. It is common for a technology team to use multiple approaches for different scenarios. This means that different teams can use different approaches to the Agile Framework. Some of the most common Agile Frameworks are:

- **SCRUM (most common)**
- **Kanban**
- **Lean**

The diagram below illustrates the differences in structure between Kanban and SCRUM.

![ef76e3804a3f272a228254a7d126070c28eb2b25](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9ec0e3e4-80c6-421b-8fa4-58e23da8071b)

## Benefits of agile team
1. **Faster time-to-market**: Agile teams can deliver working software in short iterations, allowing organizations to respond quickly to changing market conditions, customer needs and feedback. One way to do it is to build a Minimum Viable Product (MVP). An MVP is a simple, first version of a product or app that has just enough features to solve a specific problem and gather feedback from users. It’s like a basic model of a car that lets you drive and get feedback before adding more fancy features such as air conditioning, heated seats etc
2. **Increased collaboration**: Agile teams work closely together, breaking down silos and fostering better communication and collaboration between team members. This means that these teams can often work more independently to find solutions and produce results faster
3. **Higher quality**:Agile methodology emphasizes testing and feedback, allowing teams to catch and fix defects earlier in the development process. This iterative method means that the output is more stable and functional.
4. **Flexibility**: Agile methodology is adaptable to changes in project requirements, allowing teams to pivot and adjust their approach as needed. Since the team consists of a diverse set of talents, it often doesn’t have to wait for another department or team to get involved and can resolve issues on its own.

Overall, the agile set of values is a key skill for anyone entering the technology industry, as it’s become an essential approach to software development in today’s fast-paced and ever-changing business environment.

### agile workflow
Now that you know what the Agile Framework is and how it functions, let’s take a closer look at how Agile Teams work within this framework. This is important because agile teams are the name of the game in the tech industry. If you’re starting your career in tech, chances are you’re going to work in or as part of an agile team!

As we’ve mentioned before, agile teams work together to deliver high-quality software in an iterative and incremental manner. They’re like the Avengers of the tech world, working together to release excellent software step by step. They’re not waiting around for a manager to shout out orders. Nope, they’re the captains of their own ship, making decisions and steering towards success. Traditional teams might need a bossy boss, but agile teams? They’re the masters of their own destiny! In other words, Agile Teams are responsible for managing their own work and making decisions to achieve goals. They don’t need constant direction.

Now in order to be self-organizing and take ownership, these teams are empowered to make decisions about their work. This includes how to plan and execute their tasks, how to communicate with one another, and how to resolve conflicts and issues that arise. Plus, they keep tabs on their progress and aren’t afraid to switch gears and make adjustments if needed. Talk about flexibility at its finest!

So why does this matter? Well, it’s the secret sauce of the Agile Methodology. They are an important aspect of the Agile Methodology because they allow for more flexibility and adaptability in the process of developing software. When teams have control, it fosters creativity, innovation, and teamwork. Each team member is fully invested in the project’s success.

### difference between traditional team and agile team
![3d8052b40268196a5fdd8ae9293a2eefb6731a15](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b6cbd176-bf86-4660-85db-0e0f256eea4f)

Let’s imagine an agile development team working on a software development project. The team is made up of a front-end developer, two back-end developers, a tester, a product manager, and a scrum master. They work in short, time-boxed iterations called sprints, usually lasting one or two weeks. During a sprint, the team focuses on delivering a set of features or functionalities.

At the beginning of each sprint, the team holds a sprint planning meeting to define the work to be done and estimate the effort required, which usually refers to the time it would take to complete the task.

During the sprint, the team works collaboratively to complete the work, holding daily stand-up meetings to keep everyone informed and identify any obstacles that need to be addressed. At the end of the sprint, the team holds a sprint review or retrospective to reflect on their progress and identify areas for improvement. By the way, retrospectives are also referred to as retros in up-to-date tech language.

The team is self-organizing, meaning they manage their own work and make decisions about how to accomplish their goals.

Now, let’s imagine a traditional development team working on the same software project. The team is composed of front-end and back-end developers, testers, a project manager, and a business analyst. Notice the difference in composition? The team follows a sequential, waterfall approach to software development, with a clear division of labour between team members.

The project manager is responsible for defining the scope and requirements of the project, and the business analyst is responsible for documenting those requirements.

The developers and testers work separately to complete their assigned tasks. The project manager monitors the progress of the project and reports to higher-ups on a regular basis. Team members receive direction and oversight from the project manager and are expected to follow a defined process for completing their work.

As you can see, the Agile team and the traditional team have different approaches to software development. The agile team is more collaborative, flexible, and self-organizing, while the traditional team is more structured, hierarchical, and process-driven. The agile team is better equipped to respond to changing requirements and deliver high-quality software in a fast-paced environment, while the traditional team may struggle to adapt to changing conditions and may be slower to deliver software.

### sprint planning and meetings and retros

Time to get into the weeds. When you’re working in technology teams that practice Agile development, there are several events that you will almost surely come across and be part of. The most important of these are Sprint Planning Meetings and Sprint Retrospectives. In the next few pages, you will learn more about what they entail and the best practices to have successful sprints.

You could also think of these touch points in the context of your group work as part of this program. For example, each weekly period can be thought of as a sprint. This sprint has a goal which is the deliverable for your group work. So following the Agile framework, you will be working on the tasks planned at the beginning of the sprint in a sprint planning meeting that you conduct with your group!

> In a sprint planning meeting, the team decides which tasks to work on in the next sprint and who will handle them. The meeting is attended by key stakeholders people like the Product Manager, UI/UX Designers, Engineers, and other team members.

Remember the different roles we learned about in week 5? Those are some of the team members we might expect to attend sprint planning meetings. The meeting occurs at the beginning of each sprint. During this meeting, tasks and responsibilities are assigned.

To assign roles effectively, you might want to act as the project manager of your team. Project management is related to product management but, also vastly different. In fact, project management is a subset of product management. Project managers plan, organize, and oversee projects from start to finish. They are very important in making sure projects are done well within the planned scope, budget, and time. If you choose this role, you’ll probably lead the Sprint Planning Meeting. This meeting makes sure everyone knows what needs to be done.

But how can you as a project manager do so? Well, remember the backlog we covered a few weeks back? If you can’t recall what this is, check out the ‘tech terms recap’ lesson in week 5. Basically, you can use the backlog to determine the goal and tasks for the sprint.

These backlogs are usually groomed ahead of the sprint planning meeting by the Product or Project Manager. To groom a backlog, ensure that tasks or tickets in your project management platform have the correct details. This includes effort required, user stories, and acceptance criteria. A well-groomed backlog ensures that a sprint planning meeting is organized and thorough. When you plan for your team meeting, creating an agenda helps with future backlog grooming.

The meeting starts with the Product Manager presenting the project’s vision and goals. The team works together to set a clear goal for the sprint. This goal represents what they want to achieve. For example, if the project is to develop a mobile app, the sprint goal could be to implement the login functionality.

### Retrospective
- **Create a safe and inclusive space**: Encourage everyone to participate and make sure everyone’s ideas and opinions are respected. It’s important that everyone feels comfortable sharing their thoughts without fear of judgment or criticism.
Be honest and open
- **Encourage everyone to be truthful about their experiences during the sprint**. Honesty is key to understanding what went well and what needs improvement. Remember, it’s not about blaming anyone, but rather finding ways to work better together.
Focus on observations and facts
- **When discussing what happened during the sprint, try to stick to objective observations and facts rather than personal opinions**: For example, instead of saying, “I think the design was bad,” you can say, “We received feedback from users that they found the design confusing.”
- **Use a collaborative approach**: Involve everyone in the discussion and decision-making process. Encourage brainstorming and gathering ideas from all team members. This way, you can have a variety of perspectives and find the best solutions together.
- **Identify both successes and areas for improvement**: Recognize the things that went well during the sprint and celebrate them. It’s equally important to identify areas where you faced challenges or didn’t meet your goals. This helps you learn from both the positive and negative experiences.
- **Set SMART goals**: Based on the discussion, establish clear and specific goals for the next sprint. Make sure these goals are; specific, measurable, actionable, relevant, and time-bound. For example, instead of saying, “We should improve communication,” you can say, “Let’s have a daily stand-up meeting to share progress and challenges.”
- **Follow up on action items**: After the retrospective, it’s important to take action on the goals and improvements identified. Assign responsibilities and track progress to ensure that the agreed-upon changes are implemented.

## terms
**Sprint**: This is a short, time-boxed period (it’s usually a week or two in most technology companies), where SCRUM teams work to complete a certain set of work.

**Product backlog**: This is a list of features, functions that have not yet been developed into final solutions, and requirements that the development team will work on in a future iteration or sprint.

**MVP**: It’s a concept used in product development to describe the smallest version of a product that can still provide value to its users/customers.

**User personas:** User personas are fictional characters that represent different types of users who might use a product or service. These personas help developers understand their users better and design products that meet their needs. For example, let’s say you’re creating a game app. You might have a user persona named “Gamer Gina” who loves action games and another persona named “Puzzle Pete” who prefers brain-teasing games. By understanding their preferences, you can design a game that appeals to both personas.

**Wireframes:** Wireframes are like blueprints or sketches of a website or app. They show the basic structure and layout without focusing on colours, graphics, or detailed design. Think of it as drawing the outline of a house before adding all the details inside.

**Prototypes**: Prototypes are interactive mock-ups or models of a website or app. They give you a feel for how the final product will work and allow you to test and gather feedback before investing time and resources into development. Imagine you’re building a car. Before building the actual car, you might create a small-scale model to see how it looks and functions.

**User Interface**: User Interface (UI) refers to the visual elements and controls that users interact with on a website or app. It includes buttons, menus, forms, and any other elements that users see and interact with.

**User Experience**: User Experience (UX) focuses on how users feel and interact with a product or service. It’s about creating a positive and enjoyable experience for users.

**Continuous Integration**: Continuous Integration (CI) is a development practice where developers frequently integrate their code changes into a shared repository. It ensures that multiple developers’ work is combined regularly and automatically tested for any issues.

**Continuous Deployment**: Continuous Deployment (CD) is a practice of automatically deploying software changes to production environments after passing tests in the continuous integration process. It allows developers to release new features or bug fixes to users quickly and frequently, ensuring a smoother and more efficient deployment process.

**Client-side**: Client-side refers to the part of an application or website that runs on the user’s device, such as a computer or smartphone. It includes all the code and processes that occur on the user’s side, like displaying content, running animations, and handling user interactions.

**Server-side**: Server-side refers to the part of an application or website that runs on the server, which is a powerful computer or network of computers that store and process data. It handles tasks such as managing databases, processing requests from users, and generating dynamic content to be sent back to the client side.

**Agile**: Agile is an approach to project management and software development that emphasizes flexibility, collaboration, and iterative work.

**Waterfall software development**: Waterfall software development is a traditional approach to building software where each phase of the project happens in a sequence, like a waterfall flowing downward.

**Sprint planning meeting**: This is like a strategy session where you decide what tasks you’ll work on during the sprint. You discuss the goals for the sprint and break them down into smaller tasks that can be completed within the sprint’s timeframe.

**Stand-up meetings**: Stand-up meetings are short, quick meetings that happen every day during a sprint. They are called “stand-up” because everyone stands up during the meeting to keep it short and focused. In these meetings, each team member shares what they worked on the previous day, what they plan to work on that day, and if they are facing any challenges or need help. It’s like checking in with your teammates to make sure everyone is on track and to see if anyone needs assistance.

**API:** It’s like a bridge that enables different apps or systems to work together and exchange data. For example, imagine you have a music streaming app, and you want to show the lyrics of the currently playing song. You can use an API provided by a lyrics service to fetch the lyrics and display them in your app.

By this time, you’ve heard the terms Agile Teams, Agile Methodology, and Agile Framework quite a bit. Let’s explore what Agile is and how teams following this methodology function. Agile teams are typically small. They consist of about 5-9 team members with various roles. This section contains the breakdown of what an Agile Team typically looks like. Make sure you understand what each of the roles does as you’re most likely going to be working closely with people with such titles and responsibilities, or are going to have such a title yourself in the near future.

## Agile Team Structure
1. **UX researcher**: watch [this](https://youtu.be/kQ_6faxhyIw)
2. **Product Manager**: A Product Manager, also commonly known in modern tech lingo as a PM, is responsible for driving the vision, overall strategy, design, and execution of a product. This includes doing market research, competitive analysis, checking out customer feedback, and making sure that the team’s day-to-day are aligned with the business objectives. The Product Manager is also responsible for defining the product vision and making strategic decisions about pricing, positioning, and target markets, You should know, however, that not all companies have the product role specified to a Product Manager alone. Some companies might have different variations, the most common one being a Product Owner. A caveat with the two roles (PM and product owner) is that most teams, especially smaller teams from smaller companies, have only one of the two roles performing all duties related to backlog management and roadmap planning. i.e., instead of having both roles in a company’s technology team, you will just have the Product Manager or Product Owner. watch [this](https://youtu.be/pCmh6XaMVxs)
3. **Product Designer or UI/UX Designer**: Product Designers often work hand in hand with UX researchers and Product Managers to conduct user research, ensuring that they gain a deep understanding of the user’s needs, pain points, and goals. They’re responsible for turning the insights learned from user research into wireframes and prototypes, which are visualizations of the design solutions that attempt to meet the user’s needs. They also consider holistic product metrics such as user retention, growth, user acquisitions, and customer drop-offs. watch [this](https://youtu.be/S6maF4tICPs) and [this](https://youtu.be/V50sIFbp-YA)
4. **Backend software engineer**: responsible for designing, developing, and maintaining the server-side logic, and databases of a software application. watch [this](https://youtu.be/aRPOYPJPCho)
5. **Frontend software engineer**: watch [this](https://youtu.be/Gc0msPEmGjA)
6. **Fullstack software engineer**: wathc [this](https://youtu.be/7NaeDBTRY1k)
7. **mobile app developer**: Mobile software engineers are experts in programming languages like Swift (for iOS) or Java/Kotlin (for Android). They use these languages to write the code that makes the app work. They create the buttons, screens, animations, and everything else that you see and interact with within the app. watch [this](https://youtu.be/DZ-rEgAWFkQ)
8. **Devops engineer**: Imagine you have a big team of friends who are building a huge LEGO city together. Each friend has their own special LEGO pieces and tasks, like building houses, roads, and bridges. A DevOps engineer is like the person who makes sure everything runs smoothly and efficiently in the LEGO city, Next, the DevOps engineer focuses on automation. This means they find ways to make repetitive tasks in the LEGO city automated, just like using machines to do things faster and with fewer mistakes. For example, they might build a machine that can automatically place LEGO bricks in a specific order for a building, saving time and effort for the builders, The DevOps engineer also keeps an eye on the LEGO city’s performance and stability. They monitor if there are any issues, like a bridge that’s not strong enough or a road that’s not wide enough for the LEGO cars. They fix these problems quickly so that the builders can continue their work smoothly.

> Brilliant analogy aside, DevOps Engineers ensure that software development and delivery processes are streamlined, efficient, and of high quality. They focus on automating and improving the integration, testing, and deployment of software which allows teams to move faster while maintaining quality and reliability.

**Devops common tasks**

- Development and maintenance of tools, scripts, and systems that automate software deployment, testing, and monitoring.
- Manage and configure cloud infrastructure such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), to ensure that applications can scale and are resilient to failures.
- Setting up and maintaining continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines.
- Participating in sprint planning meetings to ensure alignment with development teams and that DevOps requirements are incorporated into the development process.

9. **data analyst**: First, the data analyst’s job is to collect the right information. This is something they figure out in collaboration with other team members. For example, if sales want to evaluate a new outreach strategy, the data analyst will work with them to figure out what is the best data to gather for that purpose. They then organize this information in a special way, like putting the data into groups, collating them, and giving it a proper structure. Next, they start to analyze the data. This means they look at patterns and trends. They might notice certain abnormalities and run special analysis to confirm them. The point will always be to collect evidence to confirm something or make recommendations.

The crux of the role is that data analysts collect, analyze, and interpret data to help organizations make informed decisions and solve problems. They use special tools and software to help them with their work. These tools make it easier for them to understand the data and find important information.

## Guestimation
Many times in life, we do not have the luxury of time, resources, or data to conduct full research on a decision before making it. In situations like this, we rely on our logic and guestimation powers. 

watch [this](https://youtu.be/RBC6DGCUJu8)

In guestimation, we use the **QBSC (Question, Breakdown, Solve, Consolidate)** framework to figure out a solution for your problem. The type of problem you have can range from needing to estimate the number of pizzas you should order for a party, to calculating what tax rates should be levied to mitigate inflation.

![33742db51d2b1dee3969e94ed71bee39b8301739](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/94045dce-32eb-45b7-a111-f141fd50680b)

- **Question**: What is the primary question, or problem statement you have?
- **Breakdown**: Break down your problem statements into issues that you can address individually.
- **Solve**: Solve each of your issues.
- **Consolidate**: Consolidate your issues and solutions, and create an answer for your primary problem statement.

### Guestimation Approaches
There are 2 ways to guestimate: the top-down and bottom-up approach.

- The top-down approach seeks to identify the big picture and all of its components. These components are usually the driving force for the end goal.
- The bottom-up approach focuses its analysis on specific characteristics and micro attributes of an individual project.

### Market-sizing & Guesstimate Questions Guide
the “magical” approach to solving any market-sizing or guestimate questions. wathc [this](https://youtu.be/v5eKAmZuQzs)

The 4 steps to market-sizing or guestimating are:

- Clarification
- Breaking down problems
- Solving each piece
- Consolidating

The following 2 videos show you how to answer a guesstimate problem that supposedly appeared on Google or Goldman Sachs job interviews. But the point is not to give you the exact sizing of ping pongs and technical specifications of airplanes. Instead, this video shows how to rely on only what you have in your head and whatever is available to get a reliable answer.

## Research and data gathering
### Data analysis framework
The Data Analysis Framework is a structured approach used to examine and understand data. It involves asking key questions to gain insights into the problem or situation and preparing the data for a more in-depth analysis. This framework helps guide the process of extracting meaningful information from data sets.

Essentially, this framework is a set of logical and iterative steps that, when followed appropriately, support you in your data analysis. We have simplified these steps so you can follow them later on in this module. Let’s learn what each step entails. Click through the interactives to reveal details about each step.
