## week 2
understanding yourself and building personal attributes is the main foucus this week

> When you can identify the value of your actions, you will start to be deliberate about which actions are positive and have a purpose, and which actions you can work on because they are negative and take away from your purpose.

 ![reflection](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7863f630-0723-49d9-b9ac-70e0c6ec1d42)

To help you get started with this important thought process, we want you to think back and reflect on one happy action or moment of success.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Your action or moment of success should be associated with a value. For example:
> - Winning the basketball tournament could show the value of resilience and/or teamwork.
> - Falling in love could show the value of love, trust, and/or courage.
> - Joining a yoga class could show the value of adventure and/or commitment.

> **Reflect**
>
> Take a few moments to reflect on your moment of success and its associated value. Why was this the value you associated with your moment of success?

### difference between core values and aspirational values.

- Core values are the values that you have associated with memorable events. We can also refer to these as your **actual values**.
- Aspirational values are the values that you dream/hope to live out more fully.

Everyone has aspirational values alongside their core values. Now, although it’s good to have aspirational values, it’s important to remember that only the values you practice and draw on in your life, your work, and especially in this course, become your actual core values.

**Keeping the above in mind, there are two things to take away:**

Simply dreaming about (or hoping for) other values to become a reality in your life will not change them from aspirational to core values. You have to put in the work.

Your core values are those values that you have put in the work for. You should be proud of your core values and keep on developing them, they inform your true identity.

### Chair values
![values](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e5f3788a-9597-4145-9e6a-382ca07b9bf9)

### your non-negotiable values
Highly successful people are consciously aware of their values, and practice them, even when it is hard. Part of being a thoughtful, conscientious leader is to make sure that you are holding yourself accountable to knowing and living your values, as much as possible throughout your career and lifetime. One way to do this is to be very clear with yourself on what your personal non-negotiables are - in other words, what are the values and elements of your life that matter the most to you?

Knowing what you know about yourself now, what are your rocks, pebbles and sand? Think about why they are your rocks, pebbles and sand as well!

![tree-of-values](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/37683c74-ee64-49f3-a2db-444eb2522af8)

What is your tree made out of? Grab a pen and draw it out! List out what your roots, trunk, branches and leaves are made of

Take a moment and reflect on what’s important to you. Then on piece of paper, or Google Doc on your computer, define your Rocks, Pebbles and Sand.

**Remember**:

- Rocks represent the priority items in your life e.g family, friends, health
- Pebbles are the other things that matter e.g work and school
- Sand represents everything else e.g. material possessions

### PICS
Self-awareness is a lifelong journey, and the “picture of you” in your mind becomes clearer and clearer as you collect more experiences and continue on your personal journey. But how, then, can you make decisions on the first steps of your careers, if you are still uncertain as to what your life paths should be, or what your strong points are?

A tool that you can use here to help determine what you like and what you are good at is called **PICS**:

![PICS](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6a3e90ea-69ed-42dc-8e9b-227a4c5d630f)

Answering these will help you to continue to interrogate and evaluate the path you want to take and the difference you want to make in society as a young leader and change-maker.

Define your values, follow your passion, and find your purpose. 

### Values
are the foundation for your passion and purpose, they define **what is important to you** and thereby can influence the passions you pursue and the purpose you seek to fulfill. Values are not just abstract concepts — **they should manifest in your actions**, **decisions**, and **behaviors**. When your values are in alignment with your actions, you will experience greater satisfaction and authenticity.

### Passion 
is what **drives** you to explore and engage in activities aligned with your values. Fundamental to passion is the strong and intense emotional drive that fuels its pursuit. It’s the deep, fervent interest and enjoyment you derive from a particular activity, cause, or field. Knowing what you’re passionate about can guide you in many different ways — from helping you find a career you’ll love, to deciding on what moves to make on your path, to balancing your work and life.

### Purpose 
is a broader and more profound concept that encapsulates how your values and passions come together. It is your deeper **reason for existence** — it’s **a sense of meaning and direction in life** that goes beyond personal enjoyment or fulfillment. Like your values, your purpose can help guide your actions and serve as a constant reference point for decision-making in your career. It can be a helpful guiding post for long-term planning, helping you understand your career in the context of what you ultimately want to achieve or the legacy you want to leave behind. 

Now that you know what PICS are, **it is time to self-reflect using the following questions:**

- Passions: What would you get out of bed for in the morning if money wasn’t an issue?
- Interests: What are you most curious about?
- Causes: What keeps you up at night?
- Strengths: What is your superhero power?

### personal mission statement

- What is greatness and what does it mean to me?
- What did great influential people in the world have in common, They created a life with…? (a mission)
- How have my experiences influenced my Passions, Interests, Causes, and Skills?
- What do I pledge allegiance to?

> a passionate organization is usually the result of missioned organization
> 
> a passionate individual is usually the result of a missioned individual
 
### creating one
a personal mission statement is a phrase that powers you, gives you energy and goosepump, don't make it complex, you can cahnge at any point of your life, make it short in one sentence, it is something you can be, do and give

1. Schedule some quiet time to just write: Do this once a day for a week.
2. Start with a question, and write/ type your responses down and save them. You can choose a few of the questions below, or create new ones.
- What’s important to me?
- What do I want my legacy to be?
- What does my ideal day look like?
- Who would I do anything for?
- What am I grateful for?
- When do I feel the calmest?
- What makes me feel powerful?
- What makes me different from other people?
- When do I feel most useful?
- What makes me feel alive?
- What do I wish I made more time to do?
- What am I great at?
- What’s something I haven’t done that I want to do before I die?
- If I had an extra hour each day, how would I fill it?
- Who inspires me? Why?
- Who do I want to inspire? Why?
- What am I most proud of?
- What do I pledge allegiance to (what am I committed to beyond doubt)?
- what am I inspired to be, do and give?

Do not look at your responses from the previous days, just answer each question afresh. Each time, write (or type) your responses down and save them.

4. Review your entries after you’ve been answering the questions in Step 2 for a few days

Look at all your answers from each day you did the exercise. What patterns are continuously emerging? Is anything standing out as a top goal? How does that connect to your greater purpose? Use these entries to figure out your life’s priorities. 

These should be priorities for your professional life, your personal life, and your own passions and interests. You can also name a top priority for who you are physically, mentally, emotionally, and spiritually.

5. Make a statement

Now that you’ve reviewed these entries, you should be ready to craft your own personal mission statement. You will need to write a personal mission statement that recognizes your values, and identifies how you intend to use your talents to make these values a reality in your life. If you don’t feel ready to draft your personal mission statement just yet, continue to Steps 5 and 6.

6. Hung up on identifying “the value you create”?

The antidote to this is to simply ask around! Look to people who really know you and people who you spend a lot of time with, in different contexts. These could be close friends, relatives, colleagues, teachers, and/or mentors. Ask them what you do well or what they see in you as a person, professional, and future leader. Ask for specifics, especially when it comes to less tangible skills—like charisma or creating a supportive environment.

7. Look to your idols

Research the people you admire to see how they live their lives, and what practices helped them along the way. Do some detective work to find some examples of personal mission statements from the people that you look up to. There’s a good chance that you’ll find something and, although there’s no reason for you to copy their mission statement word for word, but hopefully, it will inspire you to write your own.

- Talk about your strengths
- Talk about your area of growth
- Read out and declare your Personal Mission Statement
- Show a picture that represents your mission statements.

### emotional intelligence

Emotional intelligence is the process of understanding and facilitating emotions into rational thought

#### aspects
1. ability to **perceive emotions**: read cues like facial expression and gestures which indicate complex emotions that influence our understanding of other people
2. *8understanding emotions**: emotions convey information e:g happiness usually indicate the desire to join other people, sadness indicates a desire to avoid people
3. **using emotions to facilitate thoughts** (facilitating emotions): emotions prioritize our thinking, good system of emotional input can help you focus on the things that truly matter
4. **managing emotions**: promoting certain types of behaviors through emotions and using them to your advantages, e;g if your are sad you are more likely to be analytial, if happy to be more social and outgoing

**Harvard Business Review defines these 4 categories of emotional intelligence with their 12 sub elements**

### self awareness
- What is self-awareness?
- How does self-awareness relate to leadership?
- What determines how self-aware a person is?

take this [personality test](https://my.jobstreet.com/career-advice/article/what-is-the-best-it-job-for-your-mbti-personality-type) and this [sensitivity to criticism test](https://www.queendom.com/tests/access_page/index.htm?idRegTest=721) and this [leadership skills test](https://www.queendom.com/tests/access_page/index.htm?idRegTest=2289)

### peer coaching

Peer coaching is a type of helping relationship in which two people of equal status help one another with specific tasks or problems, using a structured format.

Peer coaching can take many forms, But at its simplest, it is simply one person playing the role of “coach” while the other is the “coachee.”

The coach asks questions and reflects the answers to the coachee, **The coach does not offer advice**. A wonderful and simple peer coaching model to start with is the **GROW** Model. In this model, the coach asks 4 simple questions of the coachee.

1. **Goal** : What do you want to achieve, what does your goal mean to you, when do you think you will meet your goal? Is your goal SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound)?
2. **Reality**: What is the current situation you are dealing with? What is needed to make your goal become a reality? what challenges do you expect to encounter? how might you deal with them? Is there a barrier that might block you from achieving your goal?
3. **Options**: What options do you have to minimize or eliminate that barrier, making it more likely that you’ll achieve your goal? Can you list 3 or 4 options? What are a few things you could do (differently) to get you closer to your goal? what are the pros and cons of each option? what factors will you use to weigh up these options?
4. **Will/Way Forward**: So what is your way forward (W)? What will you do? What is your commitment?, rate you commitment to your goal from 1 to 10, What needs to happen to make it a 10/10 likelihood that you’ll complete your goal? identify practical solutions to meet the goal like blocking out an hour a week to work? how would you feel if you meet your goal?
5. **summarize what the coachee said, Do you have any requests for me regarding how I might help you meet your commitment?**

### mindset
When people believe that they cannot change their intelligence through effort (a belief known as a “fixed mindset”) they have much poorer outcomes in many areas of life. However, when people understand that intelligence, talent, and skill can all be improved through effort, this is called a “growth mindset”. Many studies show that people with a growth mindset experience much more success than those with a fixed mindset. Look at the image below to see some fundamental differences between the two mindsets.

![mindsets](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/36423b87-f483-4596-9215-5750aec5cbeb)

When we add the word “yet,” to a statement about our abilities – for example, “I am not good at statistics yet. ” or “I don’t know how to repair a refrigerator yet. ” – it reminds us that our intelligence and knowledge are fluid and can grow. It reminds us that if we put in time and effort, we can learn more, develop more skills, and become better at things. This mindset is critical for our success!

### Grit
Grit is the passion and tenacity towards long-term, worthwhile goals. It is the capacity to stick with something and show perseverance when challenged.

Grit is crucial because it propels performance and success independent of and beyond the contributions that ability and intelligence make. Being naturally intelligent and skilled is wonderful, but to succeed and thrive, we need the capacity for perseverance.

### self regulation
We like to think of self-regulation as the next logical step you take after self-awareness,That is, now that you know how you behave in different situations, self-regulation is what you do about/with that knowledge.

**What is the difference between self-awareness and self-regulation?**

you can be self-aware and choose not to self-regulate, this is a tactic often employed by narcissistic individuals. However, to truly grow within your own emotional intelligence and leadership skills, it’s important to implement what you’ve learned in your self-awareness discovery to your self-regulation.

In the simplest terms, self-awareness is when you understand the impact of your behavior on other people. Self-regulation is being aware of this impact and making adjustments to your behavior, often for the betterment of a situation

### self imporvment

Now that you understand more about self-regulation and emotional intelligence, let’s explore the science behind self-improvement and discover a formula that promotes meaningful (long-term) behavior change.

Dr. B. J. Fogg, a psychologist, and innovator who directs the Persuasive Tech Lab at Stanford University. He advocates that the best way to improve yourself and make noticeable, long-term behavior changes is by making **incremental, tiny changes in your habits**.

make a tiny habit and reward yourself afterward immediately, tell yourself that you are awesome
only two ways are effective for longterm changes, first is changing your environment and after the changed environment change your behavior, motivation can be applied to short and moderate term of behavior changes but not for the long term

make tiny habits through out this formula: **after i do something i will do my tiny habit**

### RULER
Have you ever felt so angry or upset that you couldn’t think straight? Your brain is foggy? Did you snap at everyone around you? You felt tired, physically, even without moving at all?

Luckily, there is a simple method by which we can manage any strong or overwhelming emotions – it is called the **RULER** Method. This method relies on us becoming curious about our emotions instead of being their victims.

<img width="100%" alt="Ruler" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/966ca856-76a8-4a6d-9f14-3e78499d25b1" />

<img width="100%" alt="Ruler2" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2ec82262-b44e-45ad-9844-eeb5f8276952" />

> What are the biggest mistakes in dealing with feelings: **Ignoring them**

Think about a time when you experienced strong emotion, Transport yourself back to that moment – remember where you were, what just happened, and what you were feeling. Write these elements of that event of time down.

Now, go through it to get a better understanding of the RULER method and apply it to reflect on this event you just thought of.

## practice self improvement
What does your ideal day look like? Do you get to go for a run in the morning, or maybe sit and read the news for a bit? Do you get to journal in the evening, or call your Mom to check in?

Go onto your calendar (whether in your personal diary or on Google Calendar) and block out the times of the day that you would like to do specific tasks. It could look something like below:
 
![habitTracker](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c3e373ef-47b7-47f6-97b1-8104808a8611)

### time manage

Organizing and planning how to divide your time between activities with the goal to optimize your time to get the most important things done effectively.

take this [test](https://www.actitime.com/time-management/time-management-quiz) to test your time management skills

Say, you block out 6 - 8 pm on Monday to Friday in your calendar to complete Week 2 content. On Monday, the next step would be to break down all the tasks you need to complete during that specific time block and decide on what the frog is (i.e. what are the big things to focus on completing first). You could prioritize looking at the milestone and test first to get a sense of what they require, then go back to the relevant modules to review the context in 25-minute bursts using the Pomodoro technique.

Add an hour or two to do that one thing that gives you joy. It could be anything personal; a show on Netflix, watching the sunset, or catching up with a friend. Yes, add the fun stuff first. They too are important and give you the motivation to do the more difficult bits.

Make sure that key Online Community events are added to your calendar.

If you are in a city with a hub, consult your City Hub calendar and see if there will be any events that you would like to participate in and add them to your calendar.

Add a few contingency hours, in case of an emergency. Life happens, and when it does we want to be sure you have a few set aside to catch up on anything that is thrown off track.

Hopefully, after all this scheduling, you still have gaps in your schedule to do nothing! You can choose to leave the gaps open or add more activities you feel inclined to. Just don’t fill up every single spot on your calendar, so you have some breathing room.

Are you done? If so, well done! The important part now is for you to follow your schedule, just like an upcoming young leader is known to do :)

### prioritize
1. **Eisenhower Matrix**: it is a common tool to prioritize tasks in order of importance and urgency.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> What do you do when the clock is limited and everything is number one on your prioritization list?

Our approach and suggestion would be to take a deep breath and speak with our stakeholders to let them know about the situation. Keeping those who rely on you informed about what’s going on might give you some ideas on what to do, or they might suggest options you hadn’t considered. That’s when you can figure out how to prioritize things in a difficult situation.

### Prioritization Frameworks for tech teams: Moscow, RICE

![moscow](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/501a1465-3d0e-48c2-ab22-27044d314476)

1. **must have**: These are the features that are absolutely essential for the project or product. They are critical and cannot be compromised. In this case, the “must-have” features are the ones already in the backlog, which are considered crucial for the product’s functionality.

2. **should have**: This category includes features that are important but not as critical as the “must-have” ones. The new feature, requested by customers for interactive project data visualization, falls into this category. The team acknowledges its significance but is concerned about potentially delaying the “must-have” features.

3. **could have**: These are nice-to-have features but are not critical for the project’s core functionality. In this scenario, there’s no direct mention of “could-have” features, but it’s a category to consider for lower-priority items.

4. **won't have**: This category includes features that will not be worked on for the current version or iteration of the product. They are intentionally deprioritized.

imagine you’re part of the engineering team at a hypothetical company called FizzBuzzy that enables customers to visualize their projects. It’s a fast-growing tech startup that offers cloud-based project management software. Do not Fret, we’re going to learn about some technology roles mentioned in this scenario as the course progresses.

The company’s product manager, Jane, recently received feedback from several customers that they need a new feature that allows them to visualize their project data more interactively. This feature will require significant development effort from the software engineering team, and it’s not currently in the team’s backlog. Jane has brought this request to the engineering team, and they have started discussing how to prioritize it.

The software engineers on the team are concerned that adding this feature will delay some other critical features that are already in the backlog. The team’s lead developer, Kyanyi, suggests that they use the MoSCoW framework to prioritize the feature. He proposes that the team discusses and categorize all the items in the backlog, including this new feature, into the following categories:

Khanyi suggests that they prioritize the new feature as a “should-have” and work on it after they have completed the “must-have” features in the backlog. The software engineers are concerned that this may not satisfy the customers who have requested the new feature, but they also agree that they cannot delay the “must-have” features.

Jane brings this discussion to the leadership team, and they have some different perspectives. The VP of Sales, Akinola, believes that this new feature is critical to closing deals with some potential customers, and thus should be prioritized as a “must-have.” The CEO, Susan, agrees that the feature is important but is also concerned about the development resources needed to complete it.

After some discussion,the team agrees to prioritize the new feature as a “should-have,” but they also agree to start working on it after they have completed the next critical feature in the backlog. The software engineers agree to provide regular updates to Jane and Akinola on the progress of the new feature, and the leadership team agrees to communicate to potential customers that the feature is on the roadmap but may not be available immediately.

The team agrees to review the prioritization regularly and make adjustments as needed based on customer feedback, resource availability, and business priorities

## RICE

1. **reach:** how many people will be affected by a feature or a task within a specified period of time
2. **impact**: how much influence will the feature have on objective
3. **confidence**: how much are you confident that the task will meet it's impact and reach (will help making data-driven decision and less emotional)
4. **effort** how much effort and input the feature requires from the whole team in terms of resourcce and time

In general, when teams are prioritizing there are things to watch out for to make the process seamless and ensure that the team focuses on the right things in the right order. These are:

**Focus on Value**: Agile teams should prioritize work items that deliver the most value to the business or the users. They should prioritize features or tasks that will have the most significant impact on the business, customers, or users.

**Use Feedback**: Agile teams should use feedback from stakeholders, customers, and end-users to inform their prioritization decisions. Feedback can help teams to understand which features or tasks are most important to customers or end-users and prioritize accordingly.

**Break Work into Small Pieces**: Agile teams should break down work into small, manageable pieces that can be completed in short iterations or sprints. This approach helps teams to prioritize work items that can be delivered quickly and frequently, leading to more frequent feedback and validation.

**Collaborate**: Prioritization should be a collaborative effort that involves all team members. Teams should have a shared understanding of the priorities, and everyone should be aligned on what the team is working on and why. The scenario demonstrated by Jane and the team is a perfect example!

## GCGO

**start with your why**

- What do I want to accomplish and contribute to society?
- At first glance, which GCGO resonates with me the most?
- What challenges/opportunities feel most interesting and important to me?
- In what ways (big or small) might I creatively weave my career and societal contribution (or GCGO of choice) together over the next year?
- What resources can I curate to learn more about merging my path in tech with the GCGO(s) that resonate(s) with me?
- Why did you choose to become an entrepreneur? What are those driving factors that have you doing hard things? What is your - WHY? It will soon help you realize that people don’t buy what you create or do; they buy WHY you do it.

## regional integeration

Regional integration is challenging because it’s a multi-faceted challenge. This means that to solve this, multiple industries such as road, internet, and financial infrastructure, need to have matured to help with the cause. For example, a huge part of regional integration is being able to trade with one another. To do that, you need financial infrastructure to facilitate payments across borders and the ability to move goods safely and in good time to mention only a few things that need to work flawlessly.

Some companies working in the regional integration space include payment facilitators such as Flutterwave which aims to power a new wave of prosperity across Africa with fin-tech products that combine finance and technology.
