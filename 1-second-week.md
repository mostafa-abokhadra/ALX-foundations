## week 2
- understanding yourself and building personal attributes

> When you can identify the value of your actions, you will start to be deliberate about which actions are positive and have a purpose, and which actions you can work on because they are negative and take away from your purpose.

 ![reflection](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7863f630-0723-49d9-b9ac-70e0c6ec1d42)

To help you get started with this important thought process, we want you to think back and reflect on one happy action or moment of success.

Important! Your action or moment of success should be associated with a value. For example:

Winning the basketball tournament could show the value of resilience and/or teamwork.
Falling in love could show the value of love, trust, and/or courage.
Joining a yoga class could show the value of adventure and/or commitment.

> Take a few moments to reflect on your moment of success and its associated value. Why was this the value you associated with your moment of success?


Important!
There is a difference between core values and aspirational values.



Core values are the values that you have associated with memorable events. We can also refer to these as your actual values.
Aspirational values are the values that you dream/hope to live out more fully.



Everyone has aspirational values alongside their core values. Now, although it’s good to have aspirational values, it’s important to remember that only the values you practice and draw on in your life, your work, and especially in this course, become your actual core values.

Keeping the above in mind, there are two things to take away:

Simply dreaming about (or hoping for) other values to become a reality in your life will not change them from aspirational to core values. You have to put in the work.


Your core values are those values that you have put in the work for. You should be proud of your core values and keep on developing them—they inform your true identity.

### your non-negotiable values
Highly successful people are consciously aware of their values, and practice them, even when it is hard. Part of being a thoughtful, conscientious leader is to make sure that you are holding yourself accountable to knowing and living your values, as much as possible throughout your career and lifetime. One way to do this is to be very clear with yourself on what your personal non-negotiables are - in other words, what are the values and elements of your life that matter the most to you?




Knowing what you now about yourself now, what are your rocks, pebbles and sand? Think about why they are your rocks, pebbles and sand as well! Share you thoughts on eHub, and check what others are sharing about themselves.

Your core values are those values that you have put in the work for. You should be proud of your core values and keep on developing them—they inform your true identity.

What is your tree made out of? Grab a pen and draw it out! List out what your roots, trunk, branches and leaves are made of

Take a moment and reflect on what’s important to you. Then on piece of paper, or Google Doc on your computer, define your Rocks, Pebbles and Sand.

Remember:

Rocks represent the priority items in your life e.g family, friends, health
Pebbles are the other things that matter e.g work and school
Sand represents everything else e.g. material possessions
Once you’re done, feel free to share your reflections with your peers in your squad on eHub. What values and traits do you have to keep yourself grounded and firmly focused?

### PICS
Self-awareness is a lifelong journey, and the “picture of you” in your mind becomes clearer and clearer as you collect more experiences and continue on your personal journey. But how, then, can you make decisions on the first steps of your careers, if you are still uncertain as to what your life paths should be, or what your strong points are?

A tool that you can use here to help determine what you like and what you are good at is called PICS—Passions, Interests, Causes, and Strengths

![PICS](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6a3e90ea-69ed-42dc-8e9b-227a4c5d630f)

Answering these will help you to continue to interrogate and evaluate the path you want to take and the difference you want to make in society as a young leader and change-maker.

https://hbr.org/2019/11/the-unexpected-benefits-of-pursuing-a-passion-outside-of-work

Now that you know what PICS are, it is time to self-reflect using the following questions: 

Passions: What would you get out of bed for in the morning if money wasn’t an issue?
Interests: What are you most curious about?
Causes: What keeps you up at night?
Strengths: What is your superhero power?

### personal mission statement

What is greatness and what does it mean to me?
What did great influential people in the world have in common at TEDx Klagenfurt: They created a life with…?
How have my experiences influenced my Passions, Interests, Causes, and Skills?
What do I pledge allegiance to?

a passionate organization is usually trhe result of passionate organization

a passionate individual is usually the result of a missioned individual
they created a life with a mission

### creating one
What are the guidelines for a powerful and inspiring mission statement?
How can I apply the “Do-Be-Give” principle in my life?

a phrase that powers you, gives you energy and goosepump
make it short one sentence
don't make it complex, you can cahnge at any point of your life
something you can be, do and give

1. Schedule some quiet time to just write

Do this once a day for a week.

2. Start with a question, and write/ type your responses down and save them. You can choose a few of the questions below, or create new ones.

3. What’s important to me?
What do I want my legacy to be?
What does my ideal day look like?
Who would I do anything for?
What am I grateful for?
When do I feel the calmest?
What makes me feel powerful?
What makes me different from other people?
When do I feel most useful?
What makes me feel alive?
What do I wish I made more time to do?
What am I great at?
What’s something I haven’t done that I want to do before I die?
If I had an extra hour each day, how would I fill it?
Who inspires me? Why?
Who do I want to inspire? Why?
What am I most proud of?
What do I pledge allegiance to (what am I committed to beyond doubt)?
What am I inspired to be, do and give?

3. Repeat step two, by asking yourself the same question again for a few days.

Do not look at your responses from the previous days, just answer each question afresh. Each time, write (or type) your responses down and save them.

4. Review your entries after you’ve been answering the questions in Step 2 for a few days

Look at all your answers from each day you did the exercise. What patterns are continuously emerging? Is anything standing out as a top goal? How does that connect to your greater purpose? Use these entries to figure out your life’s priorities. These should be priorities for your professional life, your personal life, and your own passions and interests. You can also name a top priority for who you are physically, mentally, emotionally, and spiritually.

5. Make a statement

Now that you’ve reviewed these entries, you should be ready to craft your own personal mission statement. You will need to write a personal mission statement that recognizes your values, and identifies how you intend to use your talents to make these values a reality in your life. If you don’t feel ready to draft your personal mission statement just yet, continue to Steps 5 and 6.

6. Hung up on identifying “the value you create”?

The antidote to this is to simply ask around! Look to people who really know you and people who you spend a lot of time with, in different contexts. These could be close friends, relatives, colleagues, teachers, and/or mentors. Ask them what you do well or what they see in you as a person, professional, and future leader. Ask for specifics, especially when it comes to less tangible skills—like charisma or creating a supportive environment.

7. Look to your idols

Research the people you admire to see how they live their lives, and what practices helped them along the way. Do some detective work to find some examples of personal mission statements from the people that you look up to. There’s a good chance that you’ll find something and, although there’s no reason for you to copy their mission statement word for word, but hopefully, it will inspire you to write your own.


Ask for your peers’ full name. You will need to write them down here in Savanna as part of your reflection. You will work together and share/declare your Personal Mission Statements with each other.

Declare your Personal Mission Statement to your peers. You must:

Talk about your strengths
Talk about your area of growth
Read out and declare your Personal Mission Statement
Show a picture that represents your mission statements. (No need to print; you can search for a picture, save it and show it to your peers from your computer)

Ask each of them to repeat what you just shared in their own words. This is to be sure that your peers have understood you.

Ask your peers if they have any questions about your Personal Mission Statement and Answer them.


After the conversation, thank your peers for their time and swap positions until all of you have shared your personal mission and done the above exercise.


When meeting with your peers, complete the following in a Google Doc.

Write the date and time that you meet with your peers.
Share the details of the platform where you help the meeting with your peers.
If you had a call on Zoom/ Google Meet, add the meeting link here.
If you met at a City Hub, add the name of the City hub here.
Write the full names of the peers you worked with to declare your Personal Mission Statement. (Both first and last names are required.)
In 2 - 3 sentences, share your experience of the entire activity.

What did you like about it?
What were you most nervous about?
What would you change?
What were the key highlights?
