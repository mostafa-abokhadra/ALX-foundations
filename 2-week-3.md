### Morning pages
Morning Pages are a concept from the classic bestselling book on creativity The Artist’s Way by Julia Cameron

Don’t Stop | Don’t Think | Just Write!

Don’t overthink it. Just write. Think of it as “clearing out the pipes” so that you have more space to do focused and creative work.


**Here is a quick recap of how Morning Pages work:**
- Doing them first thing when you wake up is the best. But any time of day is ok.
- Get a pen and paper (or a journal) and write! The benefits come from doing this by hand - no typing!
- Write whatever pops into your head! (Really, whatever’s there. Anything! Just write it!)
- Don’t stop writing. Don’t re-read what you’ve written. Don’t go back and edit.
- If you don’t know what to write, then write, “I don’t know what to write. Maybe it’s because…” and you’re off again. Just keep the pen moving!
- Write 3 full pages.
- When you’re done, put them in an envelope (or burn them)! Don’t re-read them. Don’t share them with anyone.
- Remember, the point of Morning Pages is the **process** and **not the product**

### Empathy

This makes it a crucial skill to be used in building meaningful connections with colleagues you’re going to work with and users who’ll use the awesome technology platforms you’ll build or contribute to.

**Human-centered design (HCD):** 

Also called user-centered design, this is a term you’re likely going to see countless times in your tech career. When you understand the pain points, preferences and needs of users, you’re showing empathy to your users and the result is the creation of products/solutions/apps that are intuitive, user-friendly, and enjoyable to use.

**Collaboration:** 

if you wanna develop a healthcare app for inistance, while researching, designing, and developing an app, your team collaborates with for example insurance providers, healthcare providers, and people with chronic conditions. By listening to their perspectives and feedback, empathy is demonstrated and the result is building trust and creating a supportive community that values diverse voices.

**Ethics and integrity:** 

while developing the healthcare app and integrating feedback provided by your stakeholders, there are ethical considerations that need to be made that particularly affect technology teams. These range from factors such as data privacy _and _accessibility (especially when dealing with healthcare data) to. In your future role in a tech team, you need to advocate for user data protection ensuring that it’s well secured and access appropriately managed.

**User feedback**: 

after launching the app, it’s always good practice to collect feedback and data from your users to improve their experience on the app. It shows empathy to your users that you still care enough about their experience to continue iterating on your app to improve it for the future. You should always respond to feedback with empathy.

By putting yourself in the user’s shoes and understanding their problems, needs, and perspectives, you can design technology that makes a meaningful impact on people’s lives. In summary, empathy is a crucial skill for anyone working in technology. By practicing empathy, you can build user-centered technology solutions, collaborate effectively with colleagues, consider ethical implications, and give, and receive feedback constructively.
