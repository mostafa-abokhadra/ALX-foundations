### Morning pages
Morning Pages are a concept from the classic bestselling book on creativity The Artist’s Way by Julia Cameron

Don’t Stop | Don’t Think | Just Write!

Don’t overthink it. Just write. Think of it as “clearing out the pipes” so that you have more space to do focused and creative work.


**Here is a quick recap of how Morning Pages work:**
- Doing them first thing when you wake up is the best. But any time of day is ok.
- Get a pen and paper (or a journal) and write! The benefits come from doing this by hand - no typing!
- Write whatever pops into your head! (Really, whatever’s there. Anything! Just write it!)
- Don’t stop writing. Don’t re-read what you’ve written. Don’t go back and edit.
- If you don’t know what to write, then write, “I don’t know what to write. Maybe it’s because…” and you’re off again. Just keep the pen moving!
- Write 3 full pages.
- When you’re done, put them in an envelope (or burn them)! Don’t re-read them. Don’t share them with anyone.
- Remember, the point of Morning Pages is the **process** and **not the product**

### Empathy
The mark of an effective leader is the ability to be aware of the people you interact with, To do this, one must always seek to relate to the feelings, needs, and experiences of others

This makes it a crucial skill to be used in building meaningful connections with colleagues you’re going to work with and users who’ll use the awesome technology platforms you’ll build or contribute to.

> empathetic problem solving is the ability to really understand and feel another's perspective in a confilict or issue.
>
> empathetic problem solving is about what you do in communication while solving a problem but also about what you don't do

**What is deep listening?**

Deep listening is a way of listening where we are fully present without trying to immediately control or judge a situation, we do our best to stay in the moment and not jump ahead and define or solve the problem before we have more information, We also try to push away our preconceived notions about the situation or the people involved

**Telling**

Telling, on the other hand, is when we jump in and try to tell someone what happened before getting his or her perspective. When this happens, people tend to shut down and be resistant to solutions, even very good ones, because they don’t feel they were really heard.

**Questioning**

is about asking questions to understand what happened so that you can arrive at a workable solution, Your questions should be as neutral and judgment free as possible, Real questioning should be about revealing obstacles and uncovering alternate paths ahead

The other side of the coin is blame. Blame is about figuring out ‘who did it.’
### empathy types
1. **cognitive empathy**: i understand how you think about things, i can see thing from your perspective, very effective in giving feedback cause i know how to put it to you so it make a better sense to you, it downside that  people with only this kind of empathy can be manipulative
2. **emotional empathy**: i feel with you, if i don't care how you feel then i don't mind make you feel terribly, i don't mind to take advantages of you, it is the type that create chemistry, rapport, sympatico, downside that it can lead to emotional exhausation and burnout esp. if you are a nurse that has to deal with children in pain all day long or an hr who has to fireout every one, emotional self management skills allows you to counter that
3. **empathic concern**: when i see you in trouble, i spontaneously want to help you out

emapthy is perspective taking, recognizing that their perspective is their truth, staying out of judgment, recognizing emotions in other people and communicating that, in order to connect with you i have to connect with something with myself that knows that feeling

don't try to make things better or solve the problem, (i don't even know what to say right now, but i'm very glad you told me) rarely a response can make something better, what make something better is connection

**Human-centered design (HCD):** 

Also called user-centered design, this is a term you’re likely going to see countless times in your tech career. When you understand the pain points, preferences and needs of users, you’re showing empathy to your users and the result is the creation of products/solutions/apps that are intuitive, user-friendly, and enjoyable to use.

**Collaboration:** 

if you wanna develop a healthcare app for inistance, while researching, designing, and developing an app, your team collaborates with for example insurance providers, healthcare providers, and people with chronic conditions. By listening to their perspectives and feedback, empathy is demonstrated and the result is building trust and creating a supportive community that values diverse voices.

**Ethics and integrity:** 

while developing the healthcare app and integrating feedback provided by your stakeholders, there are ethical considerations that need to be made that particularly affect technology teams. These range from factors such as data privacy _and _accessibility (especially when dealing with healthcare data) to. In your future role in a tech team, you need to advocate for user data protection ensuring that it’s well secured and access appropriately managed.

**User feedback**: 

after launching the app, it’s always good practice to collect feedback and data from your users to improve their experience on the app. It shows empathy to your users that you still care enough about their experience to continue iterating on your app to improve it for the future. You should always respond to feedback with empathy.

By putting yourself in the user’s shoes and understanding their problems, needs, and perspectives, you can design technology that makes a meaningful impact on people’s lives. In summary, empathy is a crucial skill for anyone working in technology. By practicing empathy, you can build user-centered technology solutions, collaborate effectively with colleagues, consider ethical implications, and give, and receive feedback constructively.

## Tiny habits

Dr. BJ Fogg’s TEDx talk “Forget Big Change, Start with a Tiny Habit” was mind-blowing for so many of you. As you may recall, it touched on:

The importance of celebrating small victories.
The impact of our environment.
How to build new habits one small step at a time.
The role that motivation plays.

Fogg’s format to articulate your action plan: **“After I………(existing habit), I will………(new habit)“**

### circle of life
knowing where you currently are, and where you would like to be is a clear roadmap
  
![Circle-of-life](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d46b9ec3-d30a-4765-b99d-c71e80b18020)

- rate your satisfactioin in each category
- brains storm on how each category might get better and theoritical solution to solve it
- write down how would you like your perfect day to be, write it down from mommnet of awaken to the momment of sleeping
- make improvement list (areas where you want to improve)
- make another list for things you do that hinder you from reaching your goal
- set goals and set intentions (way of living, thinking, and being), You might set an intention to be a kinder person. Yes, I guess that could be a goal but the idea is you won’t stop once you are kind to someone once… It’s a lifesty

## Climate changes
- it is a long-term shifts in temperatures and weather patterns.
-  human activities have been the main driver of climate change, primarily due to the burning of fossil fuels (a natural
- fuel such as coal or gas, formed in the geological past from the remains of living organisms.)like coal, oil and gas.
- Burning fossil fuels generates greenhouse gas emissions that act like a blanket wrapped around the Earth, trapping the sun’s heat and raising temperatures, Greenhouse gases (GHGs) are a group of gases in the atmosphere that trap heat and contribute to the greenhouse effect, which keeps Earth's surface warm enough for life. By absorbing and re-emitting infrared radiation, these gases prevent heat from escaping into space, leading to a warming effect
- The main greenhouse gases that are causing climate change include carbon dioxide and methane. These come from using gasoline for driving a car or coal for heating a building, for example. Clearing land and cutting down forests(deforestation,) can also release carbon dioxide. The two biggest human-caused sources for methane release are agriculture (especially cows and rice farming) and oil & gas operations (leaks and intentional releases). Energy, industry, transport, buildings, agriculture and land use are among the main sectors causing greenhouse gases.

### **Methane Emissions Explained**  

Methane (CH₄) is a powerful greenhouse gas that contributes to **global warming**. It comes from both natural sources (like wetlands) and human activities. The two biggest human-caused sources are **agriculture** (especially cows and rice farming) and **oil & gas operations** (leaks and intentional releases).

## **1. Agriculture: Why Do Cows and Farms Produce Methane?**  

### **A. Cows and Other Ruminants (Enteric Fermentation)**  
- **What happens?** Cows, sheep, and goats have special stomachs (rumens) where microbes break down tough plants.  
- **Methane production:** These microbes produce methane as a byproduct, which the animals **burp out** (not farting, mostly!).  
- **Why it’s a problem?** There are **billions** of livestock worldwide, making this a huge methane source.  

### **B. Manure Management**  
- **What happens?** When animal poop is stored in large piles or liquid lagoons (common in big farms), bacteria break it down **without oxygen**, releasing methane.  
- **Solution?**  
  - **Cover manure storage** (to capture methane for energy).  
  - **Compost manure** (reduces methane by using oxygen).  

### **C. Rice Farming**  
- **What happens?** Rice grows in flooded fields, which creates low-oxygen conditions where bacteria produce methane.  
- **Solution?**  
  - **Alternate wetting & drying (AWD):** Let fields dry out sometimes.  
  - **Different rice strains** (some produce less methane).  

---

## **2. Oil & Gas: Where Does Methane Leak?**  

### **A. Leaks (Fugitive Emissions)**  
- **What happens?** Methane escapes from **pipelines, wells, storage tanks, and valves** due to poor maintenance.  
- **Example:** A single leaking pipeline can release methane for years unnoticed.  

### **B. Venting & Flaring**  
- **Venting:** Companies sometimes **release methane** into the air on purpose (often because it’s cheaper than capturing it).  
- **Flaring:** Burning methane (which turns it into CO₂, a less harmful gas), but sometimes flares don’t work well, releasing raw methane.  

### **C. Abandoned Wells**  
- Old oil/gas wells that aren’t properly sealed can leak methane for decades.  

### **Solutions?**  
- **Better monitoring:** Use drones, satellites, and sensors to find leaks fast.  
- **Fix leaks quickly:** Mandatory repairs for oil & gas companies.  
- **Ban routine venting & flaring:** Some countries now require methane capture instead.  

---

## **3. Why Is Methane Such a Big Deal for Climate Change?**  
- **Short-term impact:** Methane is **80x stronger than CO₂** at trapping heat in the atmosphere over 20 years.  
- **But it doesn’t last as long:** Methane breaks down in about **10-12 years**, while CO₂ stays for centuries.  
- **Good news:** If we cut methane now, we can **slow global warming quickly**!  

---

## **4. How Can We Reduce Methane Emissions?**  

### **For Agriculture:**  
✅ **Change cow diets:** Adding seaweed or special supplements can reduce burps.  
✅ **Better manure handling:** Capture methane for biogas (clean energy).  
✅ **Smarter rice farming:** Less flooding = less methane.  

### **For Oil & Gas:**  
✅ **Strict leak detection laws:** Force companies to check and fix leaks.  
✅ **Stop wasteful venting/flaring:** Use the gas instead of releasing it.  
✅ **Plug old wells:** Governments can fund cleanup of abandoned wells.  

### **For Everyone:**  
♻ **Eat less meat/dairy** (or choose sustainable farms).  
♻ **Support methane-reducing policies** (like the **Global Methane Pledge**).  

---

### **Final Thought:**  
Methane is a **super-pollutant**, but because it doesn’t last long in the air, cutting it gives us a **fast way to fight climate change**. Fixing leaks, feeding cows differently, and improving farming can make a big difference!  

The consequences of climate change now include, among others, intense droughts, water scarcity, severe fires, rising sea levels, flooding, melting polar ice, catastrophic storms and declining biodiversity.

Climate change can affect our health, ability to grow food, housing, safety and work. Some of us are already more vulnerable to climate impacts, such as people living in small island nations and other developing countries. Conditions like sea-level rise and saltwater intrusion have advanced to the point where whole communities have had to relocate, and protracted droughts are putting people at risk of famine. In the future, the number of people displaced by weather-related events is expected to rise.

the emissions that cause climate change come from every part of the world and affect everyone, but some countries produce much more than others. The six biggest emitters (China, the United States of America, India, the European Union, the Russian Federation, and Brazil) together accounted for more than half of all global greenhouse gas emissions in 2023. By contrast, the 45 least developed countries accounted for only 3 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions.

Many climate change solutions can deliver economic benefits while improving our lives and protecting the environment. We also have global frameworks and agreements to guide progress, such as the Sustainable Development Goals, the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Paris Agreement. Three broad categories of action are: cutting emissions, adapting to climate impacts and financing required adjustments.

Switching energy systems from fossil fuels to renewables like solar or wind will reduce the emissions driving climate change. But we have to act now. While a growing number of countries is committing to net zero emissions by 2050, emissions must be cut in half by 2030 to keep warming below 1.5°C. Achieving this means huge declines in the use of coal, oil and gas: production and consumption of all fossil fuels need to be cut by at least 30 per cent by 2030 in order to prevent catastrophic levels of climate change.
